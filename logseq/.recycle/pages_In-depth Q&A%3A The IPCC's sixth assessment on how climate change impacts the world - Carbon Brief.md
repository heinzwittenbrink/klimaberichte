- ðŸ“Œ Zitat: The chart below shows observed changes in the ocean between 1925-2016: warming rate (top), climate velocity â€“ the speed and direction that a given point on a map would need to move to maintain its current climate state â€“ (middle) and the change in total number of marine heatwave days, calculated as the difference between the time periods 1925-54 and 1987-2016 (bottom). Darker colours show stronger positive (red) and negative (blue) effects. #[[process: increasing risk of marine heatwaves]]
