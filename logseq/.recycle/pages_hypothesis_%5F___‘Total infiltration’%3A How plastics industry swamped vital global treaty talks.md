hypothesis-title:: ‘Total infiltration’: How plastics industry swamped vital global treaty talks
hypothesis-naming-scheme:: 0.2.0

- 📌 Zitat: These are examples of what numerous sources say is a “total infiltration” of the plastics treaty negotiations by vested industrial interests and corporate lobbyists. The core concern of six insiders who spoke to the Guardian was that the polluters are exerting too much power, not just within the negotiations but also within the UN Environment Programme (Unep), which oversees the negotiations. One source said they were “horrified” by the industry’s influence on policy and the sidelining of real solutions to plastic pollution, calling it “corporate capture”.
