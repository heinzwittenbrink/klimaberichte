hypothesis-title:: The 2024 State of CDR Report: Scaling up CO2 removal to meet Paris Targets
hypothesis-naming-scheme:: 0.2.0

- 📌 Zitat: The 2024 State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report finds that around 7–9 billion tonnes of CO2 per year will need to be removed by mid-century from the atmosphere if the world is to meet the 1.5°C Paris Agreement target.

- 📌 Zitat: Novel CDR methods – like biochar, enhanced rock weathering, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) - contribute 1.3 million tonnes per year, less than 0.1% of the total. Methods which are effectively permanent account for only 0.6 million tonnes per year – less than 0.05% of the total.

- 📌 Zitat: It is important to note here that CDR is not the same thing as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). To count as CDR, a method must capture CO2 from the atmosphere

- 📌 Zitat: few of these methods are currently targeted in government policies and proposals to scale CDR, which accounts for just 1.1% of investment in climate-tech start-ups.
