- 📝 Eine Studie von Avaaz zeigt, dass Facebook erheblich dazu beiträgt, Falschinformationen zu Klimafragen zu verbreiten. Dabei wirkt sich fatal aus, dass Facebook auf das Factchecking bei Politiker-Posts verzichtet. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/23/technology-202-researchers-warn-misinformation-facebook-threatens-undermine-biden-climate-agenda/ #[[by: Cat Zakrzewski]] #[[2021-04-23]] #[[Facebook]] #[[disinformation]] #[[Avaaz]] #[[Biden administration]] #[[Studies/Meta-Denial: How Facebook Fails to Keep Up with the Evolving Tactics of Today’s Climate Misinformers]] #USA

- 📌 Major news events drove much of the misinformation that researchers detected. The extreme weather in Texas and subsequent power outages as well Biden’s executive order to rescind the construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline were used to drive the majority of false narratives the researchers found. Misinformation related to these events accounted for 73 percent of all the estimated views in Avaaz’s findings.

- 📌 Avaaz said some of the most viral claims came from Fox News. Three of the posts that Avaaz identified were quotes or videos from Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host,  in which he made baseless claims that frozen wind turbines caused the Texas energy crisis. As of yesterday, Facebook had not applied a fact-check label to any of these posts, even though Carlson’s claims were debunked by four separate Facebook fact-checking partners, Avaaz says. Avaaz estimates the posts amassed 7,662.650 views, 31 percent of the total.
