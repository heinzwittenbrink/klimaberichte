- Given the magnitude and rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), its long lifetime in the atmosphere, and the present disequilibrium in Earth’s energy budget (expressed as the Earth’s Energy Imbalance, or EEI), both temperatures and sea level must continue to rise – even with carbon emissions lowered to net zero (where anthropogenic CO2 emissions = anthropogenic CO2 removals) – until the energy budget balance is eventually restored

- These various observations beg the question, by how much would we need to reduce atmospheric CO2 to diminish or eliminate Earth’s Energy Imbalance. Arguing that the Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) is the most fundamental metric of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing climate change under control, the GCOS community concluded that the amount of CO2 in the air would need to be reduced from 410 to353 ppm to increase heat radiation to space by 0.87 Wm2, so as to bring Earth back towards energy balance (von Schuckmann et al., 2020). Earlier, Jim Hansen, a member of the GCOS drafting group, had noted independently that CO2, the dominant climate forcing factor, must be reduced to less than 350 ppm to restore planetary energy balance and keep climate near the Holocene level, if other forcings remain unchanged (Hansen et al., 2016). Given Hansen’s recent conclusion that the EEI has now increased to 1.36 W/m2 (Hansen et al., 2023), the challenge is even greater (Summerhayes, 2024).
