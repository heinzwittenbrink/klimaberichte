	- Abstract
	              
	                In light of uncertainties regarding climate sensitivity and future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, we explore the plausibility of global warming over the next millennium which is significantly higher than what is usually expected. Although efforts to decarbonize the global economy have significantly shifted global anthropogenic emissions away from the most extreme emission scenarios, intermediate emission scenarios are still plausible. Significant warming in these scenarios cannot be ruled out as uncertainties in equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) remain very large. Until now, long-term climate change projections and their uncertainties for such scenarios have not been investigated using Earth system models (ESMs) that account for all major carbon cycle feedbacks. Using the fast ESM CLIMBER-X with interactive CO
