- The global mean EEI has been estimated in budget closure studies to be: 0.48 ± 0.1 W m−2 for 1971–2020 and 0.76 ± 0.2 W m−2 for 2006–2020 [25]; 0.50 ± 0.43 W m−2 for 2001–2010 [13];0.5 ± 0.2 W m−2 for 2000–2009 and 1.0 ± 0.2 W m−2 for 2010–2019 [27], suggesting an increase in EEI over recent decades.

- o explore whether GMSST warming is accelerating, we fit three statistical models to the timeseries to assess whether models that include ‘warming acceleration’ are more convincing than a linear model

- he warming trend captured by the EEA-proportional component amounts to 0.53 K over the 39.6 year period, matching the linear-model trend. However, the rate of increase rises from 0.06 K decade−1 over the first five years to0.27 K decade−1 over the last five years.

- Overall, steady accumulation of heat in the mixed layer (a linear trend) fails to explain ∼0.1 K of the peak-ENSO temperature difference. The acceleration of mixed layer energy accumulation since 2015/16 is needed to account for the exceptional GMSSTs of2023/24.

- t is plausible that the additional EEI trend is driven by a change in aerosol radiative forcing, although analysis of the spatial characteristics of EEI changes also allow for a significant role for cloud-mediated feedback mechanisms over cloudy areas of ocean

- Linear extrapolation of the near-GMSST trend of the past four decades is not a reliable basis for expectations of future warming. When interannual variability of GMSST over the past 4 decades is adequately parameterised, an acceleration in the warming trend(a quadratic term) is statistically unambiguous.

- Using this EEA-based model for GMSST, the record-breaking GMSSTs for 2023 and 2024 can largely be explained by the usual GMSST responses to the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation and the solar cycle, superimposed on the accelerating trend in response to rising EEI.

- The key conclusion is that we should not condition our expectations for the rate of surface ocean warming (and therefore of global warming) on linear extrapolation of the GMSST of recent decades.

- The warming trend found by this data-driven analysis is faster than model-based estimates applying current policy measures [44], consistent with observed EEI being greater than modelled.

- Wider society and policy makers should be aware that the rate of global warming over the last four decades is not a guide for the coming decades, otherwise there is a danger of underestimating the urgency of deep reductions in fossil fuel burning
