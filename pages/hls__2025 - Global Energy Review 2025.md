- Energy sector carbon emissions reached a new record in 2024 Total energy-related CO 2 emissions increased by 0.8% in 2024, hitting an all-time high of 37.8 Gt CO 2 3 . This rise contributed to record atmospheric CO 2 concentrations of 422.5 ppm in 2024, around 3 ppm higher than 2023 and 50% higher than pre-industrial levels. In 2024, CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion grew by around 1% or 357 Mt CO 2, while emissions from industrial processes declined by 2.3% or 62 Mt CO 2. Emissions growth was lower than global GDP growth (+3.2%), restoring the decades-long trend of decoupling emissions growth from economic growth, which had been disrupted in 2021
