- We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt. Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled. We are stepping into a critical and unpredictable new phase of the climate crisis.

- Global tree cover loss rose from 22.8 megahectares (Mha) per year in 2022 to 28.3 Mha per year in 2023, reaching its third-highest level (figure 2f); this was at least partly because of wildfires, which caused tree cover loss to reach a record high of 11.9 Mha(figure 3n).

- Carbon dioxide levels were recently observed to be surging (NOAA 2024). Furthermore, the growth rate of methane emissions has been accelerating, which is very troubling (Shindell et al. 2024). Nitrous oxide is also at a record high (figure 3c)

- Ocean acidity and ocean heat content are both at record extremes(figure 3f, 3g), which has led to various ocean-related climate impacts. For example, heat waves in 2021 and 2023 caused marine animal mass mortality events (White et al. 2023, Goreau and Hayes 2024).

- Because the Earth system is strongly nonlinear, extreme weather and disaster rates can increase dramatically in response to global warming, including impacts on plant and animal life (figure 3m, 3o and supplemental figures S4 and S5; Calvin 2019, Robinson et al. 2021)

- Rapidly phasing down fossil fuel use should be a top priority. This might be accomplished partly through a sufficiently high global carbon price that could restrain emissions by the wealthy while potentially providing funding for much-needed climate mitigation and adaptation programs.
