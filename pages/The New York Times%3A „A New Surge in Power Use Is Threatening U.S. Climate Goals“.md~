- 📝 In den USA führen wachsende Datencenter, die u.a. durch die Industriepolitik steigende Produktion in Fabriken und immer mehr Elektrofahrzeuge zu einem steilen Anstieg des Bedarfs nach Elektrizität. Der zusätzliche Verbrauch wird in fünf Jahren etwa dem jetzigen Kaliforniens entsprechen. Die bestehenden Klimaziele werden dadurch gefährdet. Viele neue Gaskraftwerke werden bereits projektiert, unter anderem, weil die Regulierungen fossile Energien begünstigen. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html #[[2024-03-14]] #[[country: USA]] #[[industry: digital]] #[[variable: electricity demand]] #[[institution: Electric Power Research Institute]] #[[expert: Daniel Brooks]] #[[expert: Tyler H.
