hypothesis-title:: Climate scientists: concept of net zero is a dangerous trap
hypothesis-naming-scheme:: 0.2.0

- üìå Zitat: Collectively we three authors of this article must have spent more than 80 years thinking about climate change. Why has it taken us so long to speak out about the obvious dangers of the concept of net zero? In our defence, the premise of net zero is deceptively simple ‚Äì and we admit that it deceived us.

- üìå Zitat: This is a great idea, in principle. Unfortunately, in practice it helps perpetuate a belief in technological salvation and diminishes the sense of urgency surrounding the need to curb emissions now.

- üìå Zitat: The 1997 Kyoto Summit attempted to start to put that goal into practice. But as the years passed, the initial task of keeping us safe became increasingly harder given the continual increase in fossil fuel use.

- üìå Zitat: Such models represent society as a web of idealised, emotionless buyers and sellers and thus ignore complex social and political realities, or even the impacts of climate change itself.

- üìå Zitat: US argued that if it managed its forests well, it would be able to store a large amount of carbon in trees and soil which should be subtracted from its obligations to limit the burning of coal, oil and gas.

- üìå Zitat: s models could easily churn out numbers that saw atmospheric carbon dioxide go as low as one wanted, ever more sophisticated scenarios could be explored which reduced the perceived urgency to reduce fossil fuel use. By including carbon sinks in climate-economic models, a Pandora‚Äôs box had been opened.

- üìå Zitat:  Given their core assumption of incremental change, it was becoming more and more difficult for economic-climate models to find viable pathways to avoid dangerous climate change.

  updated:: 2021-04-24T14:58:27.650149+00:00
- üìå Zitat: In the end, the mere prospect of carbon capture and storage gave policy makers a way out of making the much needed cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

  updated:: 2021-04-24T14:59:37.981747+00:00
- üìå Zitat: A technology was needed not only to slow down the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but actually reverse it. In response, the climate-economic modelling community ‚Äì already able to include plant-based carbon sinks and geological carbon storage in their models ‚Äì increasingly adopted the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù of combining the two.

  updated:: 2021-04-24T15:03:35.496837+00:00
- üìå Zitat: But rather than allow ecosystems to recover from human impacts and forests to regrow, BECCS generally refers to dedicated industrial-scale plantations regularly harvested for bioenergy rather than carbon stored away in forest trunks, roots and soils.

- üìå Zitat: And it is often forgotten that trees and the land in general already soak up and store away vast amounts of carbon through what is called the natural terrestrial carbon sink. Interfering with it could both disrupt the sink and lead to double accounting.

- üìå Zitat: Given the dawning realisation of how difficult Paris would be in the light of ever rising emissions and limited potential of BECCS, a new buzzword emerged in policy circles: the ‚Äúovershoot scenario‚Äù.

  updated:: 2021-04-24T15:06:55.850121+00:00
- üìå Zitat: Unfortunately, it is widely believed that direct air capture, because of its exorbitant costs and energy demand, if it ever becomes feasible to be deployed at scale, will not be able to compete with BECCS with its voracious appetite for prime agricultural land.

- üìù Drei f√ºhrende Klimawissenschaftler kritisieren die Illusion der "Net Zero-Politiken", die darauf setzen, das 1,5¬∞-Ziel durch die Entfernung von CO2 aus der Atmosph√§re zu erreichen. Sie werfen vielen ihrer KollegInnen vor, unrealistischen Konzepten nicht offen entgegenzutreten, um ihren politischen Einfluss nicht zu verlieren. Sie kritisieren auch die bisherigen Integrated Assessment Models des Weltklimarats, die von der Voraussetzung ausgehen w√ºrde, die Klimakatastrophe lie√üe sich mit marktwirtschaftlichen Mitteln beheben und fordern auf, deutlich zu sagen, dass sich eine Erhitzung der Erde auf 3 und mehr Grad nicht durch kleine Schritte, sondern nur durch einen Bruch mit dem bisherigen Wirtschaftssystem erreichen l√§sst.

  > Anstatt uns unseren Zweifeln zu stellen, beschlossen wir Wissenschaftler, immer aufw√§ndigere Fantasiewelten zu konstruieren, in denen wir sicher w√§ren. Der Preis, den wir f√ºr unsere Feigheit zahlen mussten: Wir mussten den Mund halten √ºber die immer gr√∂√üer werdende Absurdit√§t der geforderten Kohlendioxid-Entfernung im planetarischen Ma√üstab.
  
  Greta Thunberg hat diesen Aufsatz als einen wichtigsten und informativsten Texte zur Klima- und √∂kologischen Krise bezeichnet.

- üìå Zitat: Across the scenarios produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with a 66% or better chance of limiting temperature increase to 1.5¬∞C, BECCS would need to remove 12 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.
