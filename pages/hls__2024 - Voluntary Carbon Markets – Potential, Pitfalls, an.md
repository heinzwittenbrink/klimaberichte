- The fundamental weakness as a simple fix for ‘reducing’ corporate carbon footprints is that they allow emissions from fossil fuels to continue as long as they are ‘offset’.

- Black carbon is drawn from carbon stocks that are hundreds of millions of years old; they should never be released and cannot meaningfully be offset with biological alternative sinks whose durability is always going to be vulnerable

- Neither VCM nor mandatory carbon emissions regulatory systems must be allowed to perpetuate untruthful ‘equality’ comparisons between fundamentally different carbon storage systems: a forest planted simply cannot offset coal burned.

- But, in line with the report’s recommendations, VCM mechanisms need to become managed and regulated so that they are ultimately implemented only in circumstances where all possible ‘black carbon’ emissions have been actually eliminated from the footprint of the purchaser of VCMs, so that they contribute to the removal of existing excess emissions in the Earth’s atmosphere.

- Global private finance is deeply financialized and VCM systems can only achieve so much against the backdrop of global financialization trends.iii This is a separate and important limitation to be remembered when evaluating VCMs and the role they can play. i See page 33 for example. ii The price fell to $1.7/mtCO2

- a system in which confidence is weakened will become an expensive problem for all participants. It is therefore worth looking at VCM markets from the perspective that, broadly, participants want to see a credible mechanism that is capable of doing what it has set out to do,

- The question, perhaps, is how a voluntary market is persuaded (and enabled) to shift towards a more stringent approach to transparency and scientific principles, without losing its participants. Claims of carbon neutrality based on offsetting have already met legal challenges.

- The term ‘offset’ has become somewhat linked to ‘greenwashing’, implying hollow or misleading efforts to cover up the true emissions story. In reality, carbon credits and their deployment are as good (or bad) as the standards and rigour with which they are managed.

- Following from the rigorous adoption of scientific principles, the need for rigorous metrics and monitoring emerges. Clarity about the value of any programme includes assessing how much carbon is actually being locked in; how long (and how reliably) this will last; what the immediate impacts will be on other systems in the locality; how much monitoring, defending and cost is associated with the programme, and so on.
