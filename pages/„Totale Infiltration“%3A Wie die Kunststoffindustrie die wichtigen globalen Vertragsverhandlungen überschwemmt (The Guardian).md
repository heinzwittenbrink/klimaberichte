	- Petrostates and well-funded lobbyists at UN-hosted talks are derailing a deal to cut plastic production and protect people and the planet
- Bei den UN-Verhandlungen zu einem globalen Vertrag zur Reduzierung der Plastikverschmutzung in Ottawa, Kanada, wurde Prof. Bethanie Carney Almroth von Mitarbeitern eines großen US-Chemieunternehmens umringt und beschuldigt, die Realität falsch darzustellen. Solche Vorfälle sind Beispiele für die „totale Infiltration“ der Verhandlungen durch industrielle Interessenvertreter und Unternehmenslobbyisten. Über 200 Unternehmenslobbyisten nahmen an den Gesprächen teil, weit mehr als nationale Delegationen und Wissenschaftler. Diese Lobbyisten unterstützen eine Gruppe von Erdölländern, angeführt von Saudi-Arabien, die Fortschritte blockieren, die viele Nationen anstreben. Die Kunststoffproduktion beläuft sich auf etwa 450 Millionen Tonnen pro Jahr und soll sich bis 2060 verdreifachen, was erhebliche Umweltschäden verursacht. Über 100 Nationen fordern eine Obergrenze für die Plastikproduktion, während Erdölländer und Kunststoffhersteller dies ablehnen und sich auf besseres Abfallmanagement und Recycling konzentrieren wollen.

- 📌 Zitat: These are examples of what numerous sources say is a “total infiltration” of the plastics treaty negotiations by vested industrial interests and corporate lobbyists. The core concern of six insiders who spoke to the Guardian was that the polluters are exerting too much power, not just within the negotiations but also within the UN Environment Programme (Unep), which oversees the negotiations. One source said they were “horrified” by the industry’s influence on policy and the sidelining of real solutions to plastic pollution, calling it “corporate capture”.
- 📌 Zitat:  fifth round of talks in December
- 📌 Zitat: About 450m tonnes of new plastic is produced every year and production is set to triple by 2060 under current growth rates, damaging every aspect of a safe environment.
- 📌 Zitat: Andersen was accused of an “inappropriate absence of ambition” by more than 100 environmental organisations in April 2023.
- 📌 Zitat: Critics said her statement contradicted scientific evidence that the environmental impact of plastics begins with extraction and production, not just their use.
- 📌 Zitat:  at the most recent negotiating round, in Busan, South Korea, in December,
- 📌 Zitat: All the countries have to reach a consensus, but one nation in particular stands out as a block to an effective plastics treaty: Saudi Arabia, the world’s second biggest oil producer.
- 📌 Zitat: UN summit on desertification which was hosted in Riyadh in December 2024
- 📌 Zitat: Andersen made an official visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2024
- 📌 Zitat: She was in Riyadh again on 29 June, signing a cooperation agreement on emissions reductions.
- 📌 Zitat: sought a further ministerial meeting at Davos in 2025 to discuss “strengthening of cooperation
- 📌 Zitat: The country paid Unep $1m to host World Environment Day in 2024, a similar sum paid by previous host nations, and gave the UN agency donations of more than $20m between 2020 and 2024. Some of that was contributions to Unep’s environment fund and covered arrears dating back to 2021. Many countries give money to Unep, which relies on these voluntary contributions for 95% of its income.
- 📌 Zitat: a $25m deal struck in 2019 for Unep to provide expertise in strengthening Saudi Arabia’s environmental protections.
- 📌 Zitat: Inside the plastics treaty negotiations, an official from Saudi Arabia’s ministry of energy was elected in November 2024 to the 10-person bureau of national representatives that run the treaty talks.
- 📌 Zitat: obstruction [by Saudi Arabia] takes many forms, using their 35 years of experience in derailing climate negotiations
- 📌 Zitat: More than 30 plastic and chemical industry lobby organisations have joined the negotiations since the start of 2023, almost doubling the total number.These include the US Plastics Industry Association, Plastics Europe and national plastic industry groups from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India, Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia and Korea. The group is co-chaired by a Saudi official.
- 📌 Zitat: A report by InfluenceMap in November 2024 found that plastic and fossil fuel industry groups, including ExxonMobil, Sabic, PlasticsEurope and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, “strongly advocated to weaken the ambition of the plastics treaty”.
- 📌 Zitat: One business group is particularly influential: the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, whose members include significant plastic, chemical and fossil fuel companies such as Sabic, BASF, BP, Chevron, DuPont, Dow, LyondellBasell and Shell. WBCSD has provided successive co-chairs to the business and industry group.
- 📌 Zitat: There is no official scientific advisory panel for the treaty. Instead, the self-organised Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (Scept) has attempted to fill the gap.
- 📌 Zitat: Scientists also said their criticisms of a significant 2023 Unep report on “how the world can end plastic pollution” were ignored. The scientists said the report failed to reflect the whole range of health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution and was over-optimistic about technical solutions to deal with waste plastic.
- 📌 Zitat:  fight at the next round of negotiations in Geneva in August
- 📌 Zitat: Ninety-five nations issued a “wakeup call for an ambitious plastics treaty” on 10 June at the UN Ocean Conference
