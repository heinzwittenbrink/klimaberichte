	  Transcript: my [Music] headline view on this is not one that other people find particularly appealing but it's not my job it's not the job of us as academics to worry whether we're liked or not liked is whether our analysis is agreed with or not and I would argue we've gone backwards we've not gone forward we have not progressed since Paris and I think it's really dangerous to give the impression that we have I'm not saying people haven't tried and the reason I say that is because the problem is cumulative that's the issue with climate change the carbon dioxide and and some of the other greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere year after year so welcome to the Fireside carbon chat a non nonsense climate podcast with Kevin Anderson and this is the first ever episode it isn't yeah and I'm hosting this but then we're passing on this host and ownership to you I mean a co-ownership with s in a sense um so I should introduce myself as well I'm Don mpay uh I'm a lead Outreach and educational coordinator at seus which is the center for environment and development studies at abson University and with me today and as always in the podcast I have Kevin Anderson professor at Tindle Center Manchester University also visiting researcher here at OBS University and you get to introduce yourself a bit more a bit later on because we have to go through all the practicalities of the Pod and what we're trying to do here okay before you get this um hero's journey question we we ask so um yeah so a new podcast on climate hosted by Kevin Anderson and this is some of the things I've wrote written down that I hope we can do in this format which is a bit different it's also on YouTube so so it has that crowd as well uh and we discussed a bit of this but you can as well add at the end so what we hope to do is give shorter comments and throw new logs on the fire of the climate debate and give honest and grounded critique highlight other the people's work and voices through in through interviews by you Kevin or guest host if we want to do that and bring up good examples of work that is already going on uh then do in-depth interviews around your work thoughts feelings on the issues and for the listeners I'm hoping that they're learning something new and useful it's not the same old things you heard about climate change so um I don't know if we can promise people to to have them be surprised but but at least something new and learn something about all of this then even more importantly uh inspired to meaningful and effective work uh action on all these issues on climate and all the issues connected to climate so we can Inspire but also maybe give clear starting points in all of this and lots more is there anything you feel like you want to add to this I mean it is a work in progress and we'll keep adding and changing things but well it won't always be something uh radically new but maybe often it might be a different take on an issue a different sort of lens to look at the challenges that we're facing um but obviously I mean the basic science it evolves but it doesn't change radically so that side of it doesn't change um I think sometimes the the the shock or the difference actually comes from literally from just looking from a different angle and if that if that's something that that that we can do on the podcast encourage others to look at it from different perspectives but also then ourselves look at it from different perspectives that's that would be that would be important it's always nice to someone comes in and says something I i' never thought of it like that before and that that's those moments you want then makes you go away and reflect and then sort develop a more more nuanced picture yourself yeah yeah and I think that also is um I mean bringing up other people's work uh and bringing up all I mean there's so many great books being written and there's so much so many people doing great work out there but they're not highlighted in whether it's Media or on like social media or the internet so so they're doing all of this great work but it's for in a very small space that but also I think sometimes it's you can bring in things that are not directly related to climate change so there's lot I mean there's lots of great literature lots of great ways of thinking about all sorts of issues that go back well tens and hundreds of years sometimes that you can get insights from something that's written in the 1860s about a contemporary problem like climate change and perhaps that's one of the issues is that we've just we've actually siloed climate change a little bit too much I certainly think from in terms of the e ecological challenges that we're facing which are huge know climate is just one aspect of those but it's easy and I'll falling for this all the time you know it's easy to just focus just on the climate element and also Park the other issues as if somehow they are separate but in the in the world out there the real world out there of course there's no there's no separation there's no silos that's not the world doesn't operate along the the convenient language that we use to separate the world into bits and pieces okay and then I thought we should just give a short background also on the podcast name which uh we had a back and forth and I did this long rangling thing and then I we came to this at least tentative conclusion that it should be called the Fireside carbon chat then based on the uh Fireside Chats that Roosevelt had in the uh late 20s and early 1930s uh and it was basically a radio address when he spoke directly to uh the people out there um both people that voted for him but also people in general the whole of the US population uh and it was radio new then uh kind of an Innovative medium and also just being able to have a person far away sitting down talking directly into people's homes and the podcast format is basically radio so so maybe yeah I think I think it works yeah and I think there were other similarities firstly he was writing at a time that was very difficult in the US and other part of the world as well but so there's a you know significant depression a lot of unemployment a lot of stresses in their society and the other thing was I think was quite refreshing I mean they were of their time so it's easy to critique them now you know in hindsight but um he spoke with a degree of of honesty and vision that I think is often missing when we think about the challenges that we're facing today so it didn't seem to shy away from things it didn't seem to spin things in the way that it's just become completely normalized to spin issues and in fact I'd go slightly further I think sometimes just just to blatantly lie then those lies become normalized and then if you critique them you seem to be extremist but we've ended up living a lie on lot of these issues and I felt that he cut through that um I think it's also worth pointing out because it's always easy to look at these things think there's another older white man that was speaking to the nation um and in that case I'm an older white man here but a lot of his as understand it anyway a lot of his social concerns and drive for the people of the US came through his wife through Ellena Roosevelt I mean she was a really powerful figure and had a very strong social conscience but of course at those times it was much more difficult for a woman to be heard and so she had to at some extent she had to sort of speak through her speak through her husband but I think it's important to recognize that it wasn't just him speaking it was he was speaking with a voice of others as well yeah and maybe we should emphasize also for the listeners that you are not that old you were not part of that era as well so just remind you if you're watching this on you you can kind of guess that Kevin was not part of the 1930s not quite not quite so but that's a great bridge into like your own kind of introduction so you grew up in the 60s and 70s became an engineer now a climate scientist so can you take us through some of the uh formative points in your life and give like a a shorter introduction to yourself as I get I often get asked was there some sort of great sort of Turning Point some bright light and then no I look back I can't recall any one of any particular moment um and so I I was brought up next to a a nuclear power station in the east coast very rural area on the east coast of England East Anglia as it's called where my dad worked as a mechanic as a what we call a fitter but really a mechanic um at the power station and um we just lived just down the road from the power station uh my mom eventually became a teacher in a local primary school but I lived a rural environment next to the Sea both of which I absolutely loved at a time and also in East Anglia and it's still like that there now really is a very quiet part of the UK and you had complete Freedom there was lots of what was called common land as kids we used to just call it the commons never really thought about what it meant and now of course it's it's hugely important idea of the commons the common land and there was lots of that we used to be free all and it wasn't n't just my parents all the parents that I knew their kids would be out sort of wild wandering around the the common land uh and having that there and be next to the Sea and then also talking to my dad a lot about um about engineering about science so and his interested in nuclear power but it was just in engineering and Technology more generally that gave me quite an interesting sort of mix I felt feel when I looked back on it of a real interesting in engineering and and on science but also a real love of being in a place that that felt it un unsolid if you like by a lot of industrialization I also used to go to Scotland a lot um because my dad was from an Ireland on the west coast of Scotland um where my uncle was a Shepherd over there so and I'm still go I still go there regularly now and that also colored my view seeing that beauty on the a of Aon but on the way there we used to call it my mom's original home which is in Yorkshire near a town called Doncaster and all of my mom's family came from a mining community and the mines were still operating and my brother and I when we were kids you think this was fantastic sat there looking at these Minds operating and it's only in retrospect when I look back and think those things were really important for me this combination of of nature rural environments freedom but then engineering and science seeing the nuclear power stations looking at the cied power stations and seeing all of that and I think although it didn't play particularly strongly on my mind then in any clear way when I look back I think it was it was really it was coloring how I would see the world for the rest of my life and that's still really important to me now so I I went then left school at 16 which is quite unusual for academics I suppose and went off to work on ships I liked I liked being at Sea I liked being next to the sea I liked being on the sea and I liked working on engines I liked working with my hands and and you never work with your hands actually you work with your brain and your hands and I think a lot of people particularly lot of academics are quite critical and well they say or they work with their hands they about the technicians working with their hands people who work with their hands also work with their brains if they're working with their hands they're almost always creative as well um and yet we're often quite pejorative towards those people in our societies particularly in somewhere like the UK and so I I really enjoyed that time then later on I went to university did engineering degree and then I went on to design and build offshore oil platforms so I was in in the design office and then also working offshore on the rigs quite a lot for quite a long time um and I enjoyed that as well um and at that time climate change was becoming a big issue um I I'd not come across it before so I went back to University to do a master's and then a PhD and um and then on eventually to become an academic and so that was a sort of thread to my life but I think a lot of it was by the time I got to sort of 15 16 a lot of my life had been colored by that period of my life and the rest of it sort of slaughtered in in some ways to to the Views that I developed at that time and I think very I was very fortunate we didn't we there were yeah there weren't that many middle class families in the UK in those days it was much more of a sort of working class um you either working class or you were wealthy one or the other and so I was just surrounded by People Like Us who didn't have a lot of money but you never thought about that what you had was sort of love and security and a great community and and fun and freedom and all of those things and they've played in again to how I think about the world today you start it helped me when I look back realize that a lot of the material resources that we have now um and the perhaps the aspirations we have for always more that they're part of a problem they're not what's they're not what matters in the world you know you need a basic sort of Level A sufficiency level but really anything above that I think probably is detrimental it's very hard to there's a lure of it it's very hard to stop it but uh I think it's I think if you step back from it you can often think you that's not making life richer that's making life more locked into particular things and and creating a desire for things that you probably can't get and you don't need and they're distracting you from doing the things that are really fun and and worthwhile in life so uh let's dive into the issues I mean we've I've Loosely built this on the lecture that we recorded with you in February uh 2025 so that's also on YouTube uh you can watch that or on other social media uh but I also it's more it's not summarizing and going back that much to the lecture it's rather like finding some key points that we can talk about and then we'll see how much time we have for for all of this as well uh but you brought up also this thing and this not specifically your research but you know enough about physics and everything else about it around the amach uh this is a English pronunciation exercise Atlantic meridional is that meridianal merid yeah never awful sounding is it overturning circulation as well so the stream is part of that and yeah all that and that's just one of the Tipping points uh so the question is uh what thresholds in degrees of warming are we talking about and then the whole thing around runaway climate change if you trigger one Tipping Point does that trigger another Tipping Point or several tipping points and then also connecting this back to the carbon budgets but if you if you have a point where you activate these tipping points in The Runaway climate change then the carbon budget kind of thing is not really relevant anymore right yeah that's how I see it that's cly how I see it so there are these tipping points that are out there um non larities we generally more use more common sort of language um in the sort of scientific realm and it's really tempting I think to put a number on them so when do they occur at what temperature is it is it 2.3 de or 1.7 de and I think that to some extent misunder understands these issues what we know is that they're out there somewhere and we have sort of some sort of handle and the range of temperatures that you may start to see these things playing playing out and also some of them aren't instant that you can see them building up um but so I think we have to be careful about adding too much Precision but from a policy perspective from a from a real world perspective all you really need to know is that they're not that far away quite a few of these and they are really I mean they're really serious these absolutely dire repercussions over and above the sort of standard framing of climate change as we see it which is pretty catastrophic anyway but what we know is as the temperature goes up the risks of them occurring are become greater and and it's not linear so in a sense that the you know every degree every fraction of the degree that it goes up the risk goes up by more than that and to to me as as someone looking at these issues that's what the policy makers need to be taken on board they don't need the Precision they just know that God if we if we don't do something about the emissions as they are today we're increasing the risks of these absolutely die repercussions once you have that to any reason policy framing surely has to take that into account but clearly it's not taken into account and so I I have a feeling that most of the policy realm really just it's just got the fingers crossed behind its back that that not only that this standard way of looking at climate change which is that as the emissions go up you get higher temperatures but that actually these tipping points as well that we can just ignore those and so there's almost like a sort of a a denial we accept the science but we deny that it's going to have any real implications and these Tipping Point issues we are getting nearer and nearer to these from what we can see that and some of the scientists that have been working on this that between 2.5 degre sorry between 1.5 degre Centigrade of warming and 2 deg Centigrade of warming which when we sit here in Sweden half a degree so what actually that's a that is a huge difference in the amount of energy we're putting into the atmosphere and the impact we're having on the climate almost overnight that that those differences are sufficient that you may well find that we're hitting some tipping points between them and also some of these tipping points they will play out over the longer period so you you you know you'll be locking in things like the complete melting of ice almost the complete melting of ice on Greenland that 7 meters of sea level rise that's not going to happen in a week a year even by the end of the century but by the end of the century we'll be seeing significant rises in sea level as a consequence of that but they will go on even if you stopped all emissions so that's one of the concerns some of these points that you get to even if you cease submissions then things just keep going on now it could be that actually some issues they're sufficient that you actually get a natural feedback which means that you're going to get lots more emissions as well but even when you don't get more emissions and the temperature doesn't necessarily go up anymore you've already triggered changes that are catastrophic over the you know what the medium term if you like the the the 100 Year 200 300 year period and it's very easy to think well does that period matter I me the end of the century seems a long way from now but some people listen to this their children will be alive at the end of the century their grandchildren certainly will be alive at the end of the century if we don't completely mess things up so these are these are not very long time periods away um and yet we're taking these risks with these with these huge Tipping Point issues that play out globally and they don't just play out in isolation they play out in terms of what do they mean for agriculture what do they mean for for droughts and and water that then plays out how the societies will operate how how they'll there'll be internal migration in within countries which means that will start to create tensions then you'll get external migration this will be played out um on top of other issues that are going on which often have a create some sort of military tension between regimes so you can start to see that the climate initially is just exacerbating existing tensions but then if somebody tipping Point issues play out it will be the cause of some of these tensions and we're prepared to take that risk with our own children's future with the beauty of this amazing planet that we're quite privileged to well very privileged to be on we're prepared to take that risk our policy makers the the complicit silence I think of a lot of the science Community who aren't prepared to speak out about these issues um the business people the the journalists there's a sort of a cabal of delusion here perhaps it's just too difficult to to accept but you know ultimately whether it's difficult for us or not our children have to live through the repercussions of our preferring this delusion over honesty yeah and I think um it was interesting also this uh TV interview that I saw on PBS Terra they done like in-depth kind of interviews and it was a climate scientist or a team of scientists in Florida that was actually studying the golf stream and trying to measure whether it was slowing down and there was other things as well and it was a lot of interesting things in their research but also kind of the if you zoom out you could kind of see that there is enough research being done so you can understand these greater mechanics and talking about risks but in the basic research you need more research to understand more about these yes tipping points basically so and also with the cutbacks in research funding in the US or not even being able to mention the word climate it also kind of cuts out we won't know some of these things because some of the research now it's just being shut down yes yeah we we're not short of information though about knowing that we we need to act with extreme urgency and we're in in in an emergency situation that language is often used by policy makers then they go away and do nothing in terms of developing policy that aligns with emergency but everything we know now tells us enough that we are in an emergency situation um so you know yes we do want do need more research but it's so a lot of these things are risks and a consequ quences issue the consequences are dire um and the risks are getting greater as the temperature rises um so you know we are in the position where we we're not we're not waiting for more analytical work we need to get on and put the action in place and that's what we're failing on here so far and also we can come back to another like one of these big climate uh Science News around James Hansen's work his recent work around and the title of that global warming has accelerated so that's basically his basic argument so maybe if you can like shortly summarize what what his findings are and also your kind of comments or orque of that so so Jim Hansen James Hansen um has been at the sort of cutting ede of the science well for decades now um and his interpretations of the science are as valid as more if you would like to say more conservative interpretation so often people try to contrast of um Jim Hansen and Michael man as two two ends of the the Spectrum but and at some respects that's fair because I think when you look at the science there are sufficient uncertainties in it and sufficient numbers of assumptions that you have to make but with the same array of science you can come to different conclusions they're not it's tempting to say they're radically different conclusions they're not certainly not from a policy perspective both of them say from a policy perspective we need urgent rapid change um so I think I would say that Jim's work it seems to me to be scientifically completely valid as really does Michael mans and the differences are are sort of interpretations in that um and I think probably this is fed into sometimes by our own World Views when we put the assumptions in there so you might be arguing that Michael man's assumptions are slightly more conservative slightly more hopeful and and Jim Hanson's ones are the more sort of this is not looking good so you take that more maybe not extreme but the more um impactful end of the the science and so you end up with that range and it's very easy for others then to sort of say oh look there's a huge difference and I think that I think that really misunderstands the process of Science and as we learn more of course some of these things will come together and sometimes they'll go apart again as we get might get we might find more uncertainties but overall the framing is absolutely whether when the Jim or the M Jim Hansen or the Michael man end of the spectrum the policy repercussions are are very similar but having said that I don't particularly warm to the policy um uh diagnosis if you like or or um um suggestions from either from Jim Hansen or from Michael man and I think that there we have to be quite careful often is that that the scientists are not necessarily particularly good at understanding technology or Society more generally and I would probably argue that for both of these um and and worryingly I think on that side of it although there you know the sign is it's all Pay-Per-View and very good on the other aspect of it I think the time Dimension is often missing in in really understanding how rapidly you can make these changes particularly in rolling out Technologies um so I think we need other other voices there need to step in and I think there there's there's often a muddling of Science and Engineering so you know I I come from an engineering background that's that's what I understand I I find it really fascinating to read Michael man's science and all the other wonderful science that's out there I find that fascinating and I try and contribute a small part to that but that's not my role my role is to inter take that science and interpret that in terms what that we need to do in terms of technology and and therefore social change and that's a Time Dimension element um which I think is missing from their their sorts of analysis both whether it's Jim Hansen or Michael or man a lot of scientists are in my view very gungho about technology and I would even go as far as say a lot of academic Engineers are you know they may have built something in the laboratory they may have actually got some some CAD program on their computer that allows them to produce something but producing it out there where 8.2 billion people are living where you've got towns and cities and infrastructures and all those other things that are out there as well as the politics and and culture and all those other things I think they they're often very naive about what you can actually do in the real world uh we should also talk about the Paris agreement I mean it's been 10 years since 2015 uh yeah um and uh you base also your presentation and what we need to do basically around carment B is on the Paris agreement and the language in the Paris agreement and the kind of as it targets is that the right word well I I I've never liked the language of Target I probably have't used it occasionally but I've tried not to use that language um I tried to use the word of commitment or obligation I mean that's what we made it's not not a Target they're not things to be to to try to achieve they're things to achieve um and it's interesting the UNF C is that the correct one yeah they put out like a YouTube short uh summarizing the 10 years after which was very like hopeful and yeah we're on the right track and maybe they need to do that and you have like one minute in a YouTube short so anyways but how your kind of take on this how far have the world countries come on their work that they committed to in the Paris 2015 agreement uh and also what kind of work lies ahead then for individual countries but also the International Community institutions like the cop but also especially now in a world where everything is kind of devolving into this strong autocratic men divide up the world kind of thing we're living in because then yeah where does this take us but start with like the 10 years of the Paris yes well like where are we on this work and where do we go my headline viewing this is not one that other people find particularly appealing but it's not my job it's not the job of us as academics to worry whether we're liked or not liked is whether our analysis is agreed with or not and I would argue we've gone backwards we've not gone forward we have not progressed since Paris and I think it's really dangerous to give the impression that we have I'm not saying people haven't tried and the reason I say that is because the problem is cumulative that's the issue with climate change the carbon dioxide and and some of the other greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere year after year and so if the problem is getting worse so we're now what we're over a third of a trillion tons of carbon dioxide been emitted since Paris so what we face in 2025 is a much more challenging problem that we faced at the time of the Paris agreement now progress would require that what we were doing was at a greater rate than how much harder the problem was getting well it's it's nothing like that the problem's got a lot harder and Emissions are still going up so I'm not saying that you can if you really look hard you'll find little pockets of success but if you stand back from it and look at the whole we have fundamentally failed on the or are failing on the Paris agreement it is far more difficult today than it was then so we have gone backwards the best that I think we can describe our success is that our steps backward are not as large as they may otherwise have been but that gives a very different sort of context to start to think about where we are and the challenges we face and I would argue that's a much more truthful and blunt view of where we are in 2025 and this sort of hopium nonsense that is typically sold we mustn't take away people's hope well I mean who's us who who are we to then think we have to be dishonest about or at least to to spin a narrative that's appealing to others that's not our job as as experts as academics we have to we have to say it as we see it and in my view very clearly we have gone backwards because the challenge we face today is so much more difficult than it was in 2015 and remember it's even more difficult than it was if you go back to the UNF Triple C you referred to earlier that was back in 1992 you know it's a third of a century ago and yet emissions are still going up so a third of a century since our first major agreement emissions are still Rising we've put more carbon deide in the atmosphere since our first agreement on climate change than we put in in all human history up to that point so I think any reasoned assessment the problem that we Face understanding that the problem is cumulative has to come up to the conclusion that we have failed and we are continuing to fail I would even go slightly further than say that on the 1.5 de C framing of of the Paris agreement that's gone we will we we will not be able to hold to warming of only 1.5 deg centigrade and I also have to reflect on that and say that here I am sat in Sweden in the northern hemisphere relatively wealthy white person person older man in the northern hemisphere saying we're failed at 1.5 and to recognize I have to think stop reflect what does that mean well that means that the lives and the livelihoods livelihoods and the lives of some people particularly poor communities in the global South those we we are sacri we have sacrificed their lives because it's not as if we didn't know about this we did so the high mters in our countries and the leaders in our countries that we have actively and knowingly chosen not to make major Cuts in our emissions which because we weren't prepared to make the sort of changes to our society that necessary and we are prepared to rip apart the lives and livelihoods of people in the global South but also impose significant risks on our own children's prospects I mean this doesn't it doesn't play out well for us when we think about well what does that mean about us as people you we might have a s that is one of caring but is it really how deep is that caring I don't think for us High emitters that have been part of this problem and knowing and understanding the issues I would say that our care hasn't even stretched to our own children let alone people elsewhere in the world it's it's a sort of well sometimes when I stop it's it's a dark place for me that almost more than the the science I feel like it's quite a dark place because I I think Humanity can be much more than that but there's something about the structures the cultural structures that have dominated particularly in the global North that have underplayed our value as a citizen in this and have overplayed our competitive consumer elements if you like and so I think we need to return to seeing ourselves as Citizens as parents as brothers as sisters as as members of our community and also members of a global Community because we live in a globalized world our impacts are felt elsewhere other people's impacts are felt where we are and to to understand that and through that lens of science can help understand this then I think it might move us in a more positive direction but when I look at Paris now no I think we're in we are in an absolutely dire situation there are lots of people on the climate realm who who would agree with me that 1.5 has gone that we can't stay there you and they would also have a heavy heart about it in just a handful of years from now the two degre SE framing of climate change will be where 1.5 is today if we if if every country delivers on its promises the promises they have made following on from the Paris agreement about cutting emissions or holding emissions static if you add them all together that's no change between now and 2030 by the very early 2030s the challenge for 2 degrees Centigrade will be where 1.5 is now so literally in a handful of years we will have locked out 2 degre Centigrade as well if the science is broadly correct on the size of the carbon budgets let alone issues of tipping points and I think that is really damning again because the in the UK we had our the government committee on climate change came out and gave it his report yesterday the day before it's all talking about 2040 and 2050 I mean even talk about 2030 in terms of we'll put the policies in place by then that is literally too late we're not talking about delivering from 2030 we talking about delivering between now and 2030 and the the only way that we've escaped that is by the expert Community many in the expert Community postulating future Technologies to suck carbon dioxide out the atmosphere and we've been doing this for a long time in our models because we we are prepared to almost like question the physics rather than question ifal politics we we feel that our sponsors have to be politically acceptable well the physics doesn't care whether it's politically acceptable yet we've locked into our models all sorts of you know Harry potter-esque Futures about hundreds of billions of tons being sucked out carbon dioxide being sucked out the atmosphere we're now using the language we're already use the language of negative emission Technologies which like they exist like fridges or washing machines these things don't exist at scale they're just they're just ideas in a few professors or academics heads and some incredibly small pilot schemes that's all they are but these and carbon dioxide removal all these things are built into the models we're now building in the language of overshoot we will go over the Target and then our children will come back to it that will lead on to the language of geoengineering we'll change the words of bit we'll come up with some new expression but then we'll be embedding geoengineering into those solutions to make it so that everything still fits into a politically acceptable lens it doesn't yeah the politics of today is inadequate and insufficient to address the climate challenge so our choice there is just to cross our fingers and hope for these mythical Technologies to roll out in scale or to actually be more honest with ourselves and and and drive major structural change um in the structural and social change in the near term yeah and and all I mean all infrastructure housing or Energy System changes you need to make that takes time I mean it it's a five 10 year thing yeah but what what happens then to the carbon budget framework and the the kind of numbers the Exel spreadsheets and everything when you reach the two degrees kind of level because then the two like yeah the two things in the Paris agreement are kind of gone yes what do you set an do you set a different kind of Target uh or level because talking about degrees then might not be as relevant no and maybe it's coming back to tipping points but then we don't really know exactly where they are in this um I think we have to remind ourselves that the temperature that's mean we're not focused on temperature well we are focused on temperature but temperature is just a proxy for the real issue behind all of this and that's about impacts and even there I would always argue or do argue that it's not about impacts it's about the rate of change of impacts um so if the rate of change of impacts is is one that human systems can evolve to deal with and so can ecosystems because they know we are part of the ecosystems we can't live without them so if those two can evolve with the rates of change that we're seeing then fine but if they can't then then we're in real trouble and the rates of change that we're seeing now in terms of warming and therefore the impacts I mean we're heading in a direction there's not a hope that our human systems be to deal with them our human systems already struggle to deal with the extreme weather events that we get anyway let alone the extreme weather events that are exacerbated and then increased in frequency and severity as we get more climate change and let alone on top of all that all the other ecological challenges that we're facing by you know what the damage we're doing to the oceans how can we're destroying a lot of pollinating insects and all the other things that we're completely Reliant upon so the sort of the whole nested Suite of huge challenges that we have there and the temperature just a proxy for those so if we end up meeting remember the carbon budget we use up the carbon budget for 2Â° Centigrade before we hit 2Â° Centigrade so you you know there there's this lag between the emissions you put out um so the 2 degre C carbon budget will be gone in I mean what 10 13 14 years from now very little time from now if we kept on the current levels of emissions and of course emissions are still going up um and so I think we have to come back to remind ourselves when we signed the UNF Triple C back in 1992 and I think this is really key for those of us who are interested in climate change to remember this we signed up to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and other words we have to avoid dangerous levels of climate change we didn't sign up for 1.5 or two that quantification came out later and that's why we have to revisit it from time to time because actually is our understanding from the science does it tell us that the impacts look much greater at these temperatures and that's what it typically is doing and so we have to revisit what do we think is dangerous and remember that science only informs that debate scientists have own view what's dangerous but a scientist in Sweden may have a different View to a scientist in Bangladesh so science just informs that discussion what is dangerous is is a cultural a political a social issue and Paris came up with a 1.5 to2 degre C Framing and let's also be clear those negotiations are dominated by the wealthy Global North the the the global South are held back in those at every single level where it's a matter of people attending the matter of lawyers that are there the amount of time that they get all of those things they're held back but nevertheless their voice did come through to some degree in the one .5 framing um if we fail on these then we are going to need some other way to think about these sets of issues but we're also have to start to think well what are the impacts it's not the same world a world of two degrees Centigrade of warming isn't the world we're in today and I think we're also still almost a lot of us who work on climate change sort of have a sort of a form of denial there we keep forgetting when we think about the future it's not the future like now there is no you know a new now there isn't a new now because we're in a process of Rapid change so tomorrow will be a different narrative today because we'll carry on emitting and I think it's also key to remember that we do not stabilize the temperatures until we actually stop emitting when you just reduce the emissions the temperature still goes up and so it's not a about a matter of saying oh look we've done well we've brought the emissions down by 10% that still means a rise in temperature you have to literally eliminate particularly carbon dioxide and that basically means eliminating fossil fuel use and it means eliminating it incredibly quickly as well so if we do fail on 1.5 and 2 de well we have failed in my view on 1.5 if we do fail on 2Â° Centigrade which I think we'll we will do in in in just a handful of years from now unless we do fundamentally change our approach then um then we will have to rethink and what who's the we in this I mean who are the people that will be brought into that discussion will it be people at the sharp end of climate impacts or will it be the global wealthy people from the global North who think they can insulate themselves in the climate impacts um so we will have to we need to thinking that thinking through those issues now about what what do we do to head in that direction but also I would just come back slightly on the idea that we're structurally locked in to the infrastructure which of course we are but then it takes necessary a long time to change the two elements I think are really important there first if you are serious about climate change the language I've used supp repeatedly for years now is like a martial plan on steroids like the rebuilding of Europe after the second world war after we destroyed it all so we would have to make make our key Focus focus of the productive element of our society being in in ensur we move to decarbonized Future and that's not just about the Energy System it's about the demand side as well about our houses the transport Network and all those other things but in the so there's that structural lock in but the other part of it and I think this is really key and we almost never discussed this and what I refer to as discretionary emissions most of the emissions come from a relatively small group of us a sizeable minority and those emissions aren't structurally locked in they are discretionary they could be stopped almost within the week we have just unprepared to open that debate the scientific communi Community has been unprepared the expert Community the social science Community the humanities that we've not been prepared other than the odd exception to open up that debate about actually most emissions are locked into dis are sorry not locked are embedded in discretionary activities that could be stopped if we thought climate change was serious enough and we would have put the legislation in my concern on this is who are the people who are in that group it is the climate scientists speciically the senior ones it is the policy makers The Business Leaders you know all the people that have done particularly well at of the economic growth that our society produces collectively and have taken a disproportionate um uh section of that we are unprepared to have that open that debate about discretionary missions opened up and that's where the early missions could come from it will take time to retrofit all our houses to completely switch our public transport systems to move for a massive levels of electrification that will take some time even if with a marshal plan on steroids but in the in we could be putting policies in which very rapidly ciled our discretionary missions and another important part of that is that they those two bits discretionary missions and structural locking go hand inand because where where is the productive capacity of our society today the labor and the resources are furnished in the relative luxures of people like me but those labor resources will be need to to decarbonize infrastructure to retrofit our houses to put in buses and trams and all of those other things as well as Electrify our Energy System with with zero carbon energy Supply so the the combination of those two things discretionary and moving labor and resources are key if we're going to get anywhere near even the 2 de C Framing and yet that debate is simply not being had in the climate realm um we're still just living in use language already like a Harry Potter future um and keeping our fingers crossed that somehow we'll mother through this but when when that language is used and I've heard other academics use that language will muddle through the we is important in that you that we again is Will muddle through and we're prepared to sacrifice a lot of people elsewhere as we do that MH yeah and just because something takes time to to get in place it's not a reason to delay it I mean just because if you need to build something that takes a long time that's even a better reason to start earlier or start today yeah on doing some of these things but yeah but just on that point I I regularly get asked about um you know these things take a long time to do and and you know and also they're more expensive well actually I think a lot of time are they more expensive and a lot of the Northern Hemisphere and it also affect the southern hemisphere as well but um I I don't talk too much about that that part of the world because it's not a part I feel culturally um informed about but in the northern hemisphere when Putin I see it very much as Putin Putin invaded Ukraine that that meant that we saw a rocketing in prices of of fossil fuels and that really impacted sort of average and lower income people in our societies and so governments often that to sort of bail them out to some extent because they could no longer even afford to heat their homes basic things was that because we had too much Renewables or was it because governments had chosen there to remain locked into a fossil fuel infrastructure rather than make the conversion across if we if we made the conversion across if we started in 1992 and not just had in addition to fossil fuels but actually as a substitute for fossil fuels then we would have been anywhere near as beholden to the Russians for on the globalized fossil fuel market so I think actually if if a lot of our policy makers were serious about the security and the well-being of their citizens today they would be making these sorts of changes so it's it's not that that oh these things are just expensive actually they can be really positive for us in terms of in this case um the energy costs of people particularly the prices of people living in average income and low income that's majority of people in our society who really struggled then and they're still often struggling with Energy prices but it also improves air quality it's better for job security so there are lots of things that are really positive about a policy landscape which is addressing the climate challenge seriously um but we seem to just look at as if some it's just a cost yeah I I would argue the status quo what we're doing today is where the real costs are almost regardless of climate change yeah and maybe in a very concrete sense I mean a wealth tax or tax on billionaires would be one way of funding this uh but that's uh that might be popular with a majority but it might not be so popular with the billionaires so yes and also yes definitely I mean I find it I find there's something to me deeply concerning about um a system that sees it perfectly reasonable to see the some individuals have more GDP almost like more income than the GDP of a country in some countries and also it doesn't just come with the money it comes of course with the power because if you get weak policy makers and often policymakers are quite shallow people they EAS not all of them but they easily get taken in you know the billionaire Rings them up and they'll be you know they'll they'll yes sir no sir what would you like um and so I think we have to you know question the billionaires and how is reasonable our society does that supports that but also it's not just about the billionaires it's about the professors it comes a lot closer at the home and it's easy to point at the the billionaires out there um from positions of of relative luxury that lots of others of us in our society have so I think there's a sizable minority of us who are reluctant to see a change um in the overall framing if you say it's something like a wealth tax whatever it may it may well be um I mean there are in terms of the actual policies to drive the changes in each country I do think they're quite culturally specific so what what would work in China would be different to what worked in Sweden what would work in Sweden would probably different to the US or the UK and so I think the actual policies themselves are things that governments need to put in place I me some way prefer taxes some way prefer regulations and standards so I there are a suite of policy options for driving emissions down what I quite like about the carbon budget framing is a sort of subsidiarity concept once you've got a way to allocate the budget out to to nations in a way that's in in in line with our unfc and our Paris agreement once you've got that then you can say to Nations well it's up to you you stay within that that's that's your choice I don't think we should be imposing particular policy Frameworks on Nations it's up to them to to determine that um yeah yeah and the European Union established like a pandemic uh Recovery Fund after the pandemic and now the discussion a parallel discussion to climate and how you actually get funds for all of this around defense spending it's both Emergency Loans but it's also discussion of like a temporary tax yes and probably tax taxing the yeah with inflation everything else it's not it's not going to be taxing the people that doesn't have money there's a discussion at least of wealth tax in some countries so so that how that kind of debate plays out which is might be a different field from climate but it is related and then the risk is always that all the money that goes into that means there's no money going into like how we transform Society yeah I think there there are two things in that one the the language we repeatedly hear um in in at least in my experience in the UK and the Europe but I gather it's same in the states the cost of living crisis austerity that we haven't got we are incredibly wealthy and if I just think about the UK we governments been banging on for years now about the cost of living crisis we don't have a cost of living crisis we have an equity crisis we are we got what 68 69 million people living in the UK and in absolute terms we're the sixth or seventh richest country in the world with with only 84% of the PO world's population so a really small percentage of the world's population and we're incredibly wealthy yet we still use the language of austerity and cost of living crisis there is no cost of living crisis um other than the one that is deliberately imposed because we want to hand out the huge wealth and the annual income of the UK to a small group of people relatively small group of people and that language of course is reinforced by the journalists so we then live again in another imaginary world rather than the real world where we we have huge resources in someone like the UK but that's true a lot of the global North countries so we could easily be addressing these these challenges but it's where do we describe where do we ascribe the resources and then going back to you mentioned um you know pandemic in the UK and I think it's just this happened elsewhere every Thursday evening people would come out of their houses and get a pan and bang it to thank the wonderful workers who literally were putting their lives on the line whether that's the bus drivers or whether it was the the nurses or some of the other Medics or the anciliary staff in the hospitals you people doing or people working in the supermarkets you know across the board but a lot of these people were the people who were the least wellp paid in our society so we weren't prepared to pay them but we were prepared to P bang pans for them and at the end of that we never ended up paying them anymore anyway so we just let them die at larg and in larger numbers with this sort of poent that we cared but I think that also demonstrated again where is the true value in our society was it were we really short of billionaires during the pandemic or were we short these people who were you know or these people we really had to Value who are making the system still operate at significant risk to themselves so I think there are I think there are lessons to learn from that which we did not learn we didn't relearn actually real value is not where we're placing it at the moment you know there there are lot lots of people in our society do wonderful work that we just take for granted and if you think of it like that then you start to think well there actually there there's huge resources in our society that we can mobilize in different ways but our governments are reluctant to do that and partly part because they come from those backgrounds themselves but also because they know that who owns the mainstream media is the very wealthy you know so and and the Business Leaders and all the others The Narrative around any sort of change that is going to be socially Progressive is going to be one that is opposing it it's not that most people are against it but the the narrative that will be dominating the media is one that's against it and and that in that way I think the system we have today is sort of locked into failure and until we can break out of that um and some of the disruption that we've seen over recent years maybe say suggest there were early signs of that and I'm not saying any of these are necessarily good but if you go from brexit to the yellow vs in France to what's happened in the US that you can look at these in different ways I'm not saying I'm not trying to make any comment about whether it's good or bad all I'm simply making the comment is there's a lot of dissatisfaction with the way the establishment has been for a long time and perhaps it isn't about perhaps these are all of a sign of unrest that could be precursors or symbols of a need for some sort of change now that change of course could go in a really negative Direction which at the moment probably more suggesting it's going to do that the more Progressive Direction but that perhaps those degrees of unrest are there and that is a point at which you can see change if you're like a social Tipping Point maybe maybe we've seen some early signs that it's there but I say it doesn't seem to me at the moment he's tipping in a more Progressive Direction it seems almost going the other way going back to your point about we've moved from from a sort of rules-based society but I think had huge problems with it anyway but we've moved from that to supposedly powerful men otherwise known as bullies in this case and the Art of the deal and this sort of framing yeah I could be wrong about this I hope it doesn't last but I also hope we don't go back to exactly the rules based system that we had before because that that had locked in all sorts of problems and inequalities in our world um anyway y uh okay we're going to switch over to the two final points I have here on my list and now it's a bit more podcasty fun light since we covered all the the heavy issues yeah it doesn't have to be light but so I I came up with this category at the end of the podcast so let's add a slide to Kevin's presentation it's your PowerPoint presentations are quite long as it is but I thought it'd be fun uh at least for some of these podcast episodes that we can like well I found this this might be fun to to add uh I say I haven't seen this before no you haven't seen it we have not prepared in that sense so this is a quote by David Graber uh late David gyber an author Anarchist uh he's written a lot of I don't think yeah maybe there's one or two up here in the bookshelf as well I think there has been a war of the imagination over the last several years I was thinking a lot about what there might be to be optimistic about and I came to the conclusion that this feeling of hopelessness that everybody has is a manufactured product and that's what neoliberalism is really about neoliberalism isn't just an economic program it's a political program designed to produce hopelessness and kill any future Alternatives and I thought this connected to your last slide um and this quote by gramsky that you used yeah yeah uh so so yeah and this also like is very much where I am like there you you you end up in this very dark place of hopelessness but then you start feeling like uh is it me tell telling this story or is this story coming from somewhere else is this like is it my is my feelings attaching to somebody else story or way of framing the issues so yeah I I do think our imagination has been deliberately constrained um and I also I I spent during my PhD I went back into the O industry for one year to earn enough money so I could sit in on a large part of an economics course cuz I was really unimpressed by what I'd learned about economics but I thought PS I need to know more about it several years later I left the eics course thinking H well I don't think it really has a lot to to offer at least that sort of the if you like the market type economics um but now well over quite a few years I'm beginning to think that was only ever used as an instrumental tool by and I've started to use the language of near liberalism I was reluctant to use it at first but I think it is it is appropriate and that's a power struggle that's a power issue and they just use economics and this idea of free market economic we we've never had free market economics we're nowhere near free market economics even a country like the US spends about half of its GDP approximately is determined where it's going be spent by the state and even after musk has done what he's done there'll still be a large proportion of their GDP is spent by the state so we've never had free markets we what we have are constrained markets um and I think the neoliberal agenda was misused economics as if to sort of suggest that's the way we need to look at the world because it could fit it fits nicely with the some of the arguments he trying to make which is about power and maintaining power within relatively small groups and Elites and one of the great ways of doing that is to is to constrain imagination and to break us all down into being individuals so collectively we have far more power than the trumps than the musks than the Bezos and the gates of this world so these people only have power because we have been broken down into individuals but collectively we have more power um we have more power and we have more economic wherewith all than any of these people but it the the longer they can maintain us as individuals the less then the the more limited is our imagination of conceiving of Alternatives and I that's why I quite like the Robert uner float Robert anger quote um that we lack the imagination to con and courage to conceive that the future can be indeed will be different and I that's really important there that we need to open up that landscape that imagination um and once you do that you start to think of different ways of looking at the world but that's been deliberately constrained by the the neoliberal agenda project whatever you want to call it program which has been phenomenally successful in my darker moments I'm I'm concerned here that that that framework that cultural framework has is being so successful it just sucks everything else in so almost every culture that gets near it I always think in my head I use the sort of the black hole metaphor as you approach it everything gets sucked in and destroyed and that's how it seems to be at the moment so I sometimes think well are we and I should say here one of my colleagues I really doesn't like me using this sort of way of framing it but is how I see it and I hope his view is more is correct but I would not be surprised if we had up been just a little you know blip in the fossil record that that was us and we've been here for a long time but in terms of the largest population it's only a very short period of time and we were we were very very few people on the planet for for most of human history it's only really been post Enlightenment and mostly post-industrial Revolution where the population is rocketed and in that time a particular culture has emerged which seems to be destroying all the other cultures that actually had survived some of them for centuries if not Millenia so I am slightly concerned that NE liberal agenda may be one that we simply can't escape everything is sucked in but the nice thing about a black black hole metaphor is there are on the Event Horizon on the outside of the black hole there are things that escape little Quantum events and it might be those that allow us to find a new way to escape the ne liberalism in my view neoliberalism will not be able to address the challenges that we're facing it's had a relatively short life and it's already found wanting in terms of living in the physical constraints the ecological constraints and I would argue the social and human constraints the planet in which we live but at the moment we don't seem to find Alternatives not not at Large Scale there are a few people standing up against it but there are no so on climate alone there are no climate Progressive countries in the global North every country claims as a leader like the UK and so forth then to liberally fabricate the numbers to make it look like they're doing really well I mean basically whatever language you want to use around it we're broadly lying to each other about about that and there are there are a few examples you know Columbia has stood up and said we're not going to exploit more fossil fuels a huge pressure has been put on them to try and do that the moment they're holding that so there are a few examples of of leaders who are who have shown strength and commitment but by and large they're not they not come from the so-called Progressive countries that neoliberalism this quote seem to capture it really well that that neoliberalism is real is the real challenge to climate change and ultimately if I was given the do I think neber neol liberalism will out out outdo outlive be more important than the physics know every time I come down on the physics the physics will beat it this is just an ephemeral phase the problem is is it one that will last so long that it will make it impossible for us to escape it and then of course once we've gone we'll Escape it the world will live perfectly well without us here or is it one that we can we can our Humanity can escape out of this this black hole that sucks us all in um into a way of looking at the world that is simply unsustainable so I agree with the quote I don't I wouldn't say I wouldn't call it light this I think this is even darker than some of the things we were talking about before maybe it becomes even darker no no and I think also I mean thinking of it as a economic or cultural Powers kind of system it's still a system made up by human beings uh making choices and and I think also being critical around the discussion around neoliberalism I mean and also around globalization in the early 2000s a lot of people that had really Fierce critique of neoliberalism was still painting neoliberalism as this all powerful always winning kind of system uh their critique was very valid but you in the students minds or in your own mind you got the sense that this system can't be beat you can critique it but you can't really beat it and the discussion of Alternatives or like starting points of how do we change the system in like our small own local worlds was not part of it no no I think that's absolutely key we need to find that's this is the point that the success of it almost beyond anything else is about locking out imagination if you if you open up imagination that's the role of well seus is is a wonderful place for doing that but you know that that's the role of a lot of educational institutes this how how it is how it should be to me is is to start removing some of those boundaries that our cultural norms impose upon us and then out of those I don't know you know where they will go but that's the Su sense that's the beauty of it there's a sort of a flowering if you like and again it will be culturally different in countries I mean Leo liberalism is an agenda that's that's do ated much to the global North but it it's not without some opposition significant opposition and I think it's true to say in some parts of the global South and some of the really powerful countries one obvious ones that we might think about you know some people may argue there's elements of neoliberalism there but I think they all also elements that are very different that doesn't mean to say that they don't come with their huge challenges and problems as well um but I wouldn't go as far as to say there is no way out of it um I think there probably are way out of it I think we could postulate ways out of it we can imagine ways out of it um but they're not being delivered at the moment but I think that's partly because this lack of imagination and to break us down into individuals if we start to come together as collectives then I think we can be far more powerful than the than the powerful few that dominate the near liberalism agenda yeah and I think also some of those initiatives and people coming together that is happening in the US right now but we're not seeing that I mean social media some things kind of seep through but but there's initiatives and there's traditional actors like unions but also more like Loosely Affiliated organizations coming together but that is history being made now uh so exactly that and that's my point I made earlier that there's a lot of unrest that's manifest in different ways and it's easy to misread that I think so you I'm sure a lot of people yeah I won't hide I have no time for Donald Trump but I didn't I I wouldn't if I was living in the US I don't think I could have voted for the Democrats either I would have to vote somewhere else um but I think that that that dis well that that dissatisfaction in some respects is is a symbol of that we haven't been happy with how things are that there is this we are in this process of change but where it where does it go from here and I don't think that's set in stone as to where it goes from here I think you know it's there's a you know it could go in a number of directions the problem for me from a climate point of view is it imposes a timeline that is so incredibly tight and if we don't abide broadly by that or operate or change things within that timeline then you know the physics doesn't really care about our political machinations he doesn't really care about our cultures and our Humanity the physics will literally play out um and make it incredibly difficult for us to maintain or hold on to any meaningful Humanity with significant numbers of people still on the planet so that that timeline dimension of the physics I think is is a real challenge so we are seeing some shifts some changes will they play out in the in the in a sufficiently short time the jewelry is out on that at the moment but it it won't do unless we are more honest and open up our imaginations Okay so we're going to wrap this up uh and I'm going to put you on the spot I I should maybe have also maybe I'm putting myself on the spot as well uh but are there any books or other material or people's work something that is on your mind now or on your desk or in your bag uh that you want to bring up well I want to bring up is an interesting one I mean that my reading and this is how I deal with some of the challenges so we all deal with these things differently and my my reading at the moment I've got um bike packing in Scotland one of the books I'm reading and so I mean I think this is probably is worth mentioning this is that for a lot of people when you start to understand the challenges we Face the climate ones the Border ecological ones and indeed I think lots of them more sort of social ones and and sometimes what we do as a species and our Humanity you can be left in a very dark place and I think that is I I I I understand but can't empathize with those that really struggle with that I think it there is a real risk and I think we have to be well it's not just a risk it's a reality for some people that this is psychologically incredibly ch challenging for them I can only talk so I can I can appreciate others have that and that's why I say I can understand it but can't empathize with it CU I don't have that it's not that I have some great you know Wonderful belief and and some unsubstantiated hope that we're going to easily get out of this I don't but I I am able to park that to some extent and move away from it but it also feeds back into things when I'm looking think I'm keing cyclist and there's a beauty in the landscape the flowing through the landscape at the pace of cycling or indeed walking which is very different to being in a car or a train or something like that or even more than an aircraft and so perhaps my my outside reading my the the books and things that are important to me are ones that take me somewhere else but actually inform I suppose um indirectly inform my thinking about the world about the issues that I address at work and so my recommendation to other people from I would read say choose something else sometime that's quite different um I quite like sort of philosophical type books as well to read so there's a lovely wonderful little book um called Jonathan Livingston Seagull which I'm about to start reading again and it's it takes you you know I'm a slow reader so it'll take me a few hours but a fast reader it's just probably a couple of hours it's a wonderful book um and I think books that open up that that that process of thinking that may be novels I don't read many novels anymore I used to read a lot more novel Noel but not so much now those sorts of books I would say that where people should be looking not necessarily going to look at books that relate to the sort of challenges we face I would add one other book that I think was really good and I'm not a great fan usually of the sort populist type popular books and maybe popul books but the one by um Momo and tell pet I forgot this other person he wrote it with it's a short book and a short book is always harder to write than a long book um but short book on NE liberalism and I think it does a really good job of deconstructing it um it's not a big read it's not it's not a long read um I think perhaps it's because it does tap into things when you're reading it go oh of course oh of course it brings those of courses together into into make a very clear sort of picture so that's a book I would say is really important and has a climate element to it if you like and I have not read it but I know it's circulating here at Samus as well so so that's probably a good recommendation so I think that's everything for today uh we've done a lot of yeah this is I think this is an hour I forgot my phone somewhere so but roughly an hour as usually what we aim for uh and this is the first in this experiment this journey together so so we'll we'll see when we are back uh with the next episode and and what kind of form that will take I mean there's so many people we should interview and talk to uh and also try to bring up this other perspectives or need take something so and probably probably the important one is to escape the usual suspects I don't mean to be PR critical of them but we know who they are and it's to bring in other voices that that will actually you know that do come to these issues from a different perspective with a different lens okay great thank you Kevin so much and thanks everybody listening and uh yeah uh on towards the next episode and other Adventures thank you thank you [Music]
