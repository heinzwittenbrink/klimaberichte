- As only a few ESMs have the ability to simulate CH4 interactively, the long-term impacts of potentially significant carbon cycle feedbacks from permafrost or wetlands have not been accounted for.

- Of particular relevance for this study is that CLIMBER-X includes a fully interactive carbon cycle, which enables it to interactively compute the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations for given emission scenarios, therefore explicitly taking into account the carbon cycle feedbacks. The comprehensive carbon cycle model includes the explicit treatment of permafrost carbon, chemical rock weathering and natural methane emissions from wetlands.

- simulation Figure 1 shows global air temperature, atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations and steric sea level rise over the whole simulated period (1850–3000 CE), across different model versions and three SSP scenarios. All model versions with different climate sensitivity not only realistically reproduce historical changes in global temperature, but also atmospheric concentration of CO2 and CH4 (figure 1). The results of the reference simulation with ECS = 3 ◦C is described next

- The simulated additional global warming under high ECS is disproportionately larger than what is expected from a simple linear relation between climate sensitivity and global warming.

- This is because a substantial portion of the temperature changes can be attributed to positive carbon cycle feedbacks, which act to increase the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 (Govindasamy et al 2005).

- cross the different scenarios, we find that carbon cycle feedbacks as a whole are responsible for nearly half of the additional temperature increase(compared to the reference climate sensitivity) when ECS is high, meaning that this effect is equally as important as the change in climate sensitivity(figures 4(a)–(c)).

- The response of the land carbon cycle to climate changes is primarily controlled by two opposing feedback mechanisms. The first is the CO2 fertilization effect, which increases land carbon uptake and occurs because higher CO2 concentrations stimulate vegetation to consume more carbon via photosynthesis (negative land CO2–carbon cycle feedback).

- econd, warming-enhanced soil respiration, reduces land carbon uptake and occurs when CO2 is released from the soil from heightened microbial activity (positive land climate–carbon cycle feedback). The positive carbon cycle feedback as a whole(i.e. including the ocean) is driven mainly by the land carbon response (figures 2(a)–(c)) through the temperature dependence of soil respiration.

- We have investigated the plausibility that the Earth system can undergo temperature changes significantly higher than usually expected in low-tointermediate emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP4-3.4) under a range of ECS between 2 ◦C and 5 ◦C as given by the IPCC (Forster et al 2021). Our simulations for the three scenarios show a large spread with up to a factor >3 difference in projected global temperature change resulting from uncertainties in the ECS and its interplay with carbon cycle feedbacks.
