hypothesis-title:: Climate change almost wipes out decline in global area burned by wildfires - Carbon Brief
hypothesis-naming-scheme:: 0.2.0

- 📝 Erstmals wurde genau erfasst, welcher Teil der von Waldbränden betroffenen Gebiete sich auf die menschlich verursachte Erhitzung zurückführen lässt. Er wächst seit 20 Jahren deutlich an. Insgesamt kompensieren die auf die Erhitzung zurückgehenden Waldbrände den Rückgang an Bränden durch Entwaldung. Der von Menschen verursachte – und für die Berechnung von Schadensansprüchen relevante – Anteil der CO2-Emissione ist damit deutlich höher als bisher angenommen https://www.carbonbrief.org/climate-change-almost-wipes-out-decline-in-global-area-burned-by-wildfires/ #[[increasing risk oft wildfires]] #[[Seppe Lampe]] #[[Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project]] #[[Global Carbon Budget]] #[[Maria Barbosa]] #[[attribution]] #[[David Bowman]] #[[Global burned area increasingly explained by climate change]] #[[World Weather Attribution]] #[[Natural Environment Research Council]] #[[Matthew W.

- 📌 Zitat: his study is the “key missing piece to the puzzle of tracking anthropogenic emissions”, according to Dr Matthew Jones – an independent researcher who was not involved in the study

- 📌 Zitat: ”. He notes that until now, projects like the GCB have “been forced to assume that all fire emissions are natural, therefore underestimating the effect of people on the global carbon cycle”.

- 📌 Zitat: this is the first study that actually attributes and quantifies how much climate change has affected burned area all over the world”.

- 📌 Zitat: climate change has driven an increase in burned area in most IPCC regions, with only eight of the 42 regions showing a decrease in burned area due to the changing climate

- 📌 Zitat: he authors find that on average, climate change has driven a 16% increase in burned area globally and increased the probability of experiencing months with above-average global burned area by 22%.

- 📌 Zitat: The authors also find that the impact of climate change on burned area is accelerating over time, increasing most rapidly after the 1970s. Central Australia has seen the greatest increase

- 📌 Zitat: decline in the area burned globally by wildfires over the 20th century due to land-use change has almost entirely been offset by the increase caused by global warming, a new study says.

- 📌 Zitat: Australia’s “black summer” bushfires of 2020-21 are one of the continent’s most intense and damaging fire seasons on record. The fires burned around almost 25m hectares of land, killed more than 30 people and released more CO2 than the combined annual emissions of over 100 countries. #[[Australia's bushfires 2020-2021]]
