- Between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2023, the concentration of CO2 increased by2.8 ppm, the fourth largest within-year change since modern CO2 measurements started in the 1950s. The rate of growth is typically higher during El Niño conditions due to an overall increase from fire emissions and reduced net terrestrial carbon sinks

- The annually averaged global mean near-surface temperature in 2024 was 1.55 °C ± 0.13 °C above the 1850–1900 average. The year 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record. The previous warmest year was 2023 with an anomaly of 1.45 °C ± 0.12 °C. Each of the past ten years, 2015–2024, were individually the ten warmest years on record. The analysis is based on a synthesis of six global temperature datasets (Figure 2)
