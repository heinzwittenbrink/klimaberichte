		- „Despite their importance, the key role of public relations (PR) firms has long been overlooked in the climate political space. This paper provides an exploratory overview of the extent and nature of involvement of PR firms in climate political action“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 1)
		- „the Utility and Gas & Oil sectors engage the most PR firms, and the Environmental Movement engages the fewest.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 1)
	- „and the major oil companies and electrical-supply manufactures are the heaviest employers of such firms.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 1)
	- „Our analysis shows that PR firms are a key organizational actor in climate politics“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 1)
	- „nated with and promulgated by public relations (PR) firms include the phrases “clean coal,” “renewable natural gas,” “coal country,” and “carbon footprint.”2 The efforts of PR firms have effectively instantiated these concepts into the taken-for-granted discourse regarding climate change“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „However, in addition to these organizations, PR agencies are a critical, less examined organizational influence on climate policy (“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „PR firms such as Edelman, Glover Part, Cerrell, and Ogilvy are major actors in the climate issue arena on par with conservative think tanks or environmental groups“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)

	- „Drawing on multiple datasets, we conduct a descriptive review of the engagement of key PR firms over the period 1988 to 2020“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „The public sphere is the social space in which organizations and individuals based in civil society and the market engage in debates to identify problems, develop possible solutions, and strive to generate pressure on government bodies that directs attention to and addresses their particular political issues“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „Over the last century, the public sphere has become increasingly dominated by organizational actors“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „Since economic outcomes are tied to state policy, private interests were incentivized to try to shape that policy.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 2)
	- „Additionally, government agencies become political actors in their own right, advancing their own policy agendas“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 3)
	- „Public discourse is fragmented as different, incommensurable forms of interest come into competitive play.” Organizations thus have powerful incentives to engage in activities to set the terms of the debate to favor their preferred policy outcomes“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 3)
	- „The development of the specialized industry of environmental PR would emerge in the 1970s, 10 years after the public outcry following the publication of biologist Rachel Carson’s research on the toxic legacy of chemical pesticides“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 3)
	- „Between the early 1970s and the mid-1990s, corporate PR agents and firms built advocacy structures to anticipate and manage environmental policy issues“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 3)
	- „The widespread use of PR has led to the blurring of the difference between PR activities and activism“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „that when we reframe PR and social movements as similar social processes engaged in the development and promulgation of “persuasive communications and propaganda,” it becomes clear that these two activities are part of the larger sociological processes of social conflict and change.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „including think tanks and public relations firms, form a critical component in the development and promulgation of misinformation regarding climate change.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „Thus, almost immediately after James Hansen’s dramatic testimony on climate change before Congress in 1988, PR efforts to counter climate action were launched“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „Thus, PR firms are treated as generic organizations, not as active agents, obscuring the important role that PR companies play i“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „In their important recent analysis, Michaels and Ainger (2020) provide a descriptive overview of the key PR firm“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 4)
	- „working in Europe to obstruct climate action.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 5)
	- „Much of this data is provided voluntarily, and thus, PR firms that wish to conceal certain engagements sometimes form subsidiary companies to mask their contractual relationships.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 5)
	- „This process resulted in the identification of 192 unique organizations that had engaged 627 PR firms over the period studied.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 6)
	- „From this publicly available material, we were able to identify 65 unique campaigns of varying complexity and focus carried out by these PR firms. They range from a targeted advertising campaign conducted by Burson Cohn & Wolfe in selected states to pressure US senators to vote against President Clinton’s BTU tax, Glover Park Group’s efforts to generate public support for Al Gore’s “We” campaign, to Ogilvy’s multi-year campaign to rebrand the oil company British Petroleum (BP) “Beyond Petroleum.”“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 6)
	- „We utilized three types of PR strategies: (1) third-party mobilization, (2) corporate image promotion, and (3) delegitimization of opposition.5“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 6) Die wichtigsten Strategien: Mobilisierung von Dritten, Promotion des Bildes der eigenen Firma und Delegitimierung der Opposition.
	- „These campaigns were not voluntarily disclosed and represent campaigns that the PR firm did not wish to become public knowledge. There is no way to determine the extent of campaigns of this natur“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 7)
	- „profiles aggregate a large amount of information about PR firms and their climate-related activities in one place, and as such, allows researchers to begin lifting the veil of secrecy that envelops PR firms and their work.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 7)
	- „The percentage of organizations not employing PR firms ranged from 0% for the Gas & Oil Sector to a high of 33% for Renewable Energy Sector.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 7)
	- „no statistically significant difference between the Coal/Steel/Rail Sector, the Gas & Oil Sector, and the Environmental Movement in terms of their PR firm use at the organizational level.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 9)
	- „The political science literature commonly differentiates between inside lobbying (lobbyists talking directly with politicians) and outside lobbying (which involves garnering public support for the organization and the policies it desires through public relations techniques) (K“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 9)
	- „These two spikes are due to an increase in the use of external PR firms by all of the major petroleum companies. This pattern coincides with the emergence of climate change as a national issue following the testimony of Dr. Hansen in 1989 and with the effort to enact the Kyoto Protocol between 1996 and 1997.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 10)
	- „This table shows the notable concentration of PR firm engagement by a small number of organizations“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 10)
	- „The 25 PR firms with the largest number of organizational engagements represent just 0.8% of the total sample of 627 firms. This fraction accounts for over 30% of all PR engagements over the period of the study. Additionally, the top 25% of PR firms accounts for over 70% of all PR firm engagements“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 13)
	- „The vast majority (79.7%) of PR firms work in only one sector. Only one PR firm (Edelman) has worked for organizations in all five sectors and thirteen PR firms had more than 25 engagements with the organizations in the sample. Thus, the engagement of PR firms is highly skewed“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 14)
	- „The number of shared PR firms is especially high between the Utilities and Gas & Oil sectors. T“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 14)
	- „So while it is clear that the use of PR firms is widespread, a few large corporations or major national trade associations and environmental movement organizations employ the overwhelming majority of PR firms across all of the sectors examined“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 14)
	- „to a high of 54% by the Environmental Movement Sector. The latter is unique in the extent of concentration of hiring from a single PR firm, Caplan Communications“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 14)
	- „Charles Ryan, Weber Shandwick,“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 14)
	- „Cerrell, Hill and Knowlton, and DF King were used by two of these three sectors. Edelman was hired by all three sectors.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 15)
	- „No PR firms that appear in the top ten firms used by these sectors also appeared in the Environmental Movement Sector, and no PR firms engaged by the Environmental Movement Sector appear in the top ten firms used by the other three sectors“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 15)
	- „Based on this analysis, a series of four sociograms was constructed that together illustrate the relationships between the ten organizations and PR firms that had the highest number of in each sector“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 15)
	- „The figure clearly shows the density of each network, in which the Gas & Oil Sector is densest,“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 15)
	- „Since the latter three sectors are associated with the production and use of fossil fuels, it appears that PR firms that were profiled make a strategic choice about which sectors they will represent in their work on climate change and energy matters“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 16)
	- „As this table shows, the most common strategy PR firms use is corporate image promotion. 
	  Commonly called greenwashing, corporate image promotion efforts are a major component of corporate reputation management“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „These campaigns, which can exceed $100 million in organizational expenditures in a single year, attempt to create the impression that the client organization is a trustworthy and socially responsible actor.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „Although the promulgation of scientific misinformation has been a significant factor in the overall cultural struggle over the issue of climate change, this strategy does not appear to be widespread among the PR firms profiled,“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „Little is known about the relationships between PR firms, think tanks, and trade associations and the extent of their coordination and cooperation in such misinformation campaigns“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „Astroturfing involves the creation of organizations that simulate citizen support for a corporate position“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „PR firms have developed IICs that frequently relied on third-party groups to engage“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 18)
	- „with the public, criticize opponents, and serve as the face of an advertising campaign. Campaigns intended to bolster the image of an entire sector also often relied on thirdparty groups to engage the public“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 19)
	- „Finally, given the datasets available to the public, it is virtually impossible to connect specific PR companies with specific organizations’ campaigns“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 19)
	- „Along with ExxonMobil, Koch Enterprises, Greenpeace, the Heartland Institute, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, we need to add in PR firms such as Edelman, Glover Park, Cerrell, and Ogilvy“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 19)
	- „The impact of these PR activities, especially the promulgation of misinformation to mislead the public about climate change, has been cited is several climate litigation cases.“ (Brulle und Werthman, 2021, p. 19)
