  {"id":"arenesGivingDepthSurface2018","abstract":"Foregrounding the importance of soil and more generally the surface of the earth —what is now often called the Critical Zone (CZ)— remains very difficult as long as the usual planetary view, familiar since the scientific revolution, is maintained. In this joint effort coauthored by a landscape architect, a historian of science and a geochemist, we propose what is called in history of drawing an anamorphosis, that is, a distorsion of image made through an instrument or a change in perspective. Such anamorphosis allows to shift from a planetary vision of sites located in the geographic grid, to a representation of events located in what we call a Gaia-graphic view. We claim that such a view is much better suited to situate the new actors of the Anthropocene because it brings pride of place to the CZ.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Arènes","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Latour","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Gaillardet","given":"Jérôme"}],"citation-key":"arenesGivingDepthSurface2018","container-title":"The Anthropocene Review","container-title-short":"The Anthropocene Review","DOI":"10.1177/2053019618782257","ISSN":"2053-0196, 2053-020X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","page":"120-135","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Giving depth to the surface: An exercise in the Gaia-graphy of critical zones","title-short":"Giving depth to the surface","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019618782257","volume":"5"},

The questions being asked in these texts are relatively new, and as of yet no attempt has been made to identify the major themes that are driving this research. In putting these works into dialogue with each other, across the disciplinary boundaries of history, ecology, anthropology, economics, and political science, we can see that a new subfield of academic inquiry is emerging.

  {"id":"diamondCMIP6ModelsRarely2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              In 2023, Antarctic sea‐ice extent (SIE) reached record lows, with winter SIE falling to 2.5Mkm\n              2\n              below the satellite era average. With this multi‐model study, we investigate the occurrence of anomalies of this magnitude in latest‐generation global climate models. When these anomalies occur, SIE takes decades to recover: this indicates that SIE may transition to a new, lower, state over the next few decades. Under internal variability alone, models are extremely unlikely to simulate these anomalies, with return period >1000 years for most models. The only models with return period <1000 years for these anomalies have likely unrealistically large interannual variability. Based on extreme value theory, the return period is reduced from 2650 years under internal variability to 580 years under a strong climate change forcing scenario.\n            \n          , \n            Plain Language Summary\n            In 2023, the area of winter Antarctic sea ice fell to the lowest measured since satellite records began in late 1978. It is still under debate how far this low can be explained by natural variations, and how much can be explained by climate change. Global climate models are tools used to study past and predict future global change. We show that, without climate change, the latest generation of these models are extremely unlikely to simulate a sea‐ice reduction from the mean as large as observed in winter 2023. Including strong climate change quadruples the chance of such a reduction, but the chance is still very low. When these rare reductions are simulated, sea ice takes around 10 years to recover to a new, lower, area: this indicates that Antarctic sea ice may transition to a new, lower, state over the next few decades.\n          , \n            Key Points\n            \n              \n                \n                  The latest generation of global climate models rarely simulate an Antarctic sea‐ice extent anomaly as negative as observed in winter 2023\n                \n                \n                  The return period for such an anomaly is 2650 years under internal variability, decreasing to 580 years under strong climate change forcing\n                \n                \n                  After the anomaly occurs, sea‐ice extent recovers within a decade to a new, lower state","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Diamond","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Sime","given":"Louise C."},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Caroline R."},{"family":"Schroeder","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"diamondCMIP6ModelsRarely2024","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","container-title-short":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2024GL109265","ISSN":"0094-8276, 1944-8007","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e2024GL109265","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"CMIP6 Models Rarely Simulate Antarctic Winter Sea‐Ice Anomalies as Large as Observed in 2023","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024GL109265","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"fletcherEarthRiskUrgent2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Human development has ushered in an era of converging crises: climate change, ecological destruction, disease, pollution, and socioeconomic inequality. This review synthesizes the breadth of these interwoven emergencies and underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, integrated action. Propelled by imperialism, extractive capitalism, and a surging population, we are speeding past Earth's material limits, destroying critical ecosystems, and triggering irreversible changes in biophysical systems that underpin the Holocene climatic stability which fostered human civilization. The consequences of these actions are disproportionately borne by vulnerable populations, further entrenching global inequities. Marine and terrestrial biomes face critical tipping points, while escalating challenges to food and water access foreshadow a bleak outlook for global security. Against this backdrop of Earth at risk, we call for a global response centered on urgent decarbonization, fostering reciprocity with nature, and implementing regenerative practices in natural resource management. We call for the elimination of detrimental subsidies, promotion of equitable human development, and transformative financial support for lower income nations. A critical paradigm shift must occur that replaces exploitative, wealth-oriented capitalism with an economic model that prioritizes sustainability, resilience, and justice. We advocate a global cultural shift that elevates kinship with nature and communal well-being, underpinned by the recognition of Earth’s finite resources and the interconnectedness of its inhabitants. The imperative is clear: to navigate away from this precipice, we must collectively harness political will, economic resources, and societal values to steer toward a future where human progress does not come at the cost of ecological integrity and social equity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ripple","given":"William J"},{"family":"Newsome","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Barnard","given":"Phoebe"},{"family":"Beamer","given":"Kamanamaikalani"},{"family":"Behl","given":"Aishwarya"},{"family":"Bowen","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Cooney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Crist","given":"Eileen"},{"family":"Field","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Hiser","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Karl","given":"David M"},{"family":"King","given":"David A"},{"family":"Mann","given":"Michael E"},{"family":"McGregor","given":"Davianna P"},{"family":"Mora","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"Oreskes","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"fletcherEarthRiskUrgent2024","container-title":"PNAS Nexus","DOI":"10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae106","editor":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Junguo"}],"ISSN":"2752-6542","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,28]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"pgae106","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Earth at risk: An urgent call to end the age of destruction and forge a just and sustainable future","title-short":"Earth at risk","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae106/7638480","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"forsterIndicatorsGlobalClimate2024","abstract":"Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11064126, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014–2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] °C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] °C was human-induced. For the single year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] °C in 2023 relative to 1850–1900. This is below the 2023 observed record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] °C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2–0.4] °C per decade over 2014–2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.4 GtCO2e per year over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Forster","given":"Piers M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Walsh","given":"Tristram"},{"family":"Lamb","given":"William"},{"family":"Lamboll","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Bradley"},{"family":"Hauser","given":"Mathias"},{"family":"Ribes","given":"Aurélien"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Debbie"},{"family":"Gillett","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Rogelj","given":"Joeri"},{"family":"Von Schuckmann","given":"Karina"},{"family":"Trewin","given":"Blair"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Myles"},{"family":"Andrew","given":"Robbie"},{"family":"Betts","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Boyer","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Buontempo","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Burgess","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Cagnazzo","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Lijing"},{"family":"Friedlingstein","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Gettelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Gütschow","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Ishii","given":"Masayoshi"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Lan","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Morice","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Mühle","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Kadow","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"John"},{"family":"Killick","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Krummel","given":"Paul B."},{"family":"Minx","given":"Jan C."},{"family":"Myhre","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Naik","given":"Vaishali"},{"family":"Peters","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Pirani","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Pongratz","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Schleussner","given":"Carl-Friedrich"},{"family":"Seneviratne","given":"Sonia I."},{"family":"Szopa","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Thorne","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kovilakam","given":"Mahesh V.

While climate mitigation and energy policies have been effective in lowering carbon-intensive energy supply over time, high gas prices and nuclear shutdowns in 2022 resulted in more coal use in the generation mix.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,23]]},"citation-key":"GreenhouseGasEmission2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,24]]},"language":"en","title":"Greenhouse gas emission intensity of electricity generation in Europe","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/indicators/greenhouse-gas-emission-intensity-of-1"},

Conditions have been turbulent, prices have been extremely volatile, many households and gasintensive sectors have suffered – as have many gas-importing countries worldwide. Overall gas demand in the European Union (EU) is set to fall by around 10% in 2022, a drop of around 50 billion cubic metres (bcm). Some 10 bcm of this drop is due to curtailed production rather than efficiency gains or fuel switching. But the situation could be worse: European Union and national policies, markets, consumer actions, non-Russian suppliers and mild weather have all played a part in compensating for the missing Russian deliveries. As of early December, Europe’s gas storage levels remain above their five-year average.","citation-key":"internationalenergyagencyHowAvoidGas2022","editor":[{"family":"International Energy Agency","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.","title":"How to Avoid Gas Shortages in the European Union in 2023","type":"document","URL":"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96ce64c5-1061-4e0c-998d-fd679990653b/HowtoAvoidGasShortagesintheEuropeanUnionin2023.pdf"},

  {"id":"lambDiscoursesClimateDelay2020a","abstract":"Non-technical summary\n            ‘Discourses of climate delay’ pervade current debates on climate action. These discourses accept the existence of climate change, but justify inaction or inadequate efforts. In contemporary discussions on what actions should be taken, by whom and how fast, proponents of climate delay would argue for minimal action or action taken by others. They focus attention on the negative social effects of climate policies and raise doubt that mitigation is possible. Here, we outline the common features of climate delay discourses and provide a guide to identifying them.\n          , \n            Technical summary\n            \n              Through our collective observations as social scientists studying climate change, we describe 12 climate delay discourses and develop a typology based on their underlying logic. Delay discourses can be grouped into those that: (1) redirect responsibility; (2) push non-transformative solutions; (3) emphasize the downsides of climate policies; or (4) surrender to climate change. These discourses are distinct from climate denialism, climate-impact scepticism and\n              ad hominem\n              attacks, but are often used in combination to erode public and political support for climate policies. A deeper investigation of climate delay discourses is necessary in order to understand their prevalence and to develop inoculation strategies that protect the public from their intended effects. Our typology enables scientists, climate advocates and policymakers to recognize and counter these arguments when they are used.

  {"id":"nashClimateChangeActs2021","abstract":"Climate Change Acts (CCAs) have become a key legislative tool to mitigate climate change. While various case studies have shown that ambition varies greatly, little is known about why this is the case. This comparative study aims to ﬁll this gap by examining the emergence of six CCAs across four legislatures: Scotland (2009 and 2019), Austria (2011), Denmark (2014 and 2020) and Sweden (2017). We focus on climate change discourse broadly and processes of deliberation within legislatures speciﬁcally, to explore how they inﬂuenced the ambition of the six CCAs from our analysis. We combine extensive document analysis with 43 semi-structured interviews conducted between June 2018 and May 2019. We show that heightened attention at the discursive level combined with a strong deliberative process within legislatures to underpin all of the more ambitious CCAs. Overall, governments are more likely to adopt strong CCAs when prominent discursive junctures politicize climate policy and when parliamentary deliberation is strong. The overarching climate discourse and parliamentary deliberation had an even greater inﬂuence in our case studies than the political orientation of governments. Centre-left governments adopted weak GHG emission reduction targets at times of low political salience for climate but were more ambitious when supportive politicization of climate was present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Nash","given":"Sarah Louise"},{"family":"Steurer","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"nashClimateChangeActs2021","container-title":"Climate Policy","container-title-short":"Climate Policy","DOI":"10.1080/14693062.2021.1962235","ISSN":"1469-3062, 1752-7457","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1120-1131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Climate Change Acts in Scotland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden: the role of discourse and deliberation","title-short":"Climate Change Acts in Scotland, Austria, Denmark and Sweden","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14693062.2021.1962235","volume":"21"},

Sie sind aber nicht nur Hauptverursacher des Klimaproblems, sondern können aufgrund ihrer Kapazitäten und Ressourcen zur Lösung des Problems entscheidend beitragen. Zur Sichtbarmachung wie sehr konkrete, klimapolitische Maßnahmen auf städtischer Ebene zu setzen sind, kann sowohl die Ausgangssituation, in Form von Treibhausgasbilanzen, analysiert und Ziele, in Form von einem Auskommen mit noch zulässigen Treibhausgasemissionen, dem sogenannten Treibhausgasbudget, abgesteckt werden. Durch den Einsatz der zwei zentralen, unterschiedlichen Bilanzierungsmethoden (produktions- und konsumseitig) werden in der vorliegenden Studie die der Stadt Graz zuzurechnenden Treibhausgasemissionen ermittelt, nach der produktionsseitigen Bilanzierung sind die für die Stadt Graz im Jahr 2015 Emissionen in Höhe von 1.170.210 t CO2äqu (4,1 t CO2äqu pro Kopf), nach der konsumseitigen Bilanzierung sind dies 2.770.730 t CO2äqu (9,7 t CO2äqu pro Kopf). Basierend auf diesen bilanzierten Treibhausgasemissionen ergibt sich ein Treibhausgasbudget für den Zeitraum von 2016 bis 2050 für Graz im Umfang von 42,75 Mio. t CO2äqu. Um mit diesem Budget auszukommen, müssen die Emissionen jährlich um durchschnittlich 5,6% sinken.\nDer vorliegende Bericht beschreibt die zugrunde liegenden Analysen im Detail und zeigt, dass effektiver Klimaschutz einer mannigfaltigen Politik auf allen Ebenen, in allen Bereichen des Lebens bedarf und nur durch Zusammenarbeit von Politik, Unternehmen und Konsumenten das Klima ausreichend umfangreich geschützt werden kann.","author":[{"family":"Pichler","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Steininger","given":"Karl W"}],"citation-key":"pichlerTreibhausgasbudgetFuerStadt2019","event-place":"Graz","ISBN":"978-3-9504717-3-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"de","number-of-pages":"82","publisher":"Wegener Center Verlag","publisher-place":"Graz","source":"Zotero","title":"Das Treibhausgasbudget für die Stadt Graz","type":"book","URL":"https://www.umweltservice.graz.at/infos/andere/Treibhausgasbudget_Graz_2019.pdf"},

  {"id":"scobelWarumPhilosophieUnd2021","abstract":"Was haben Quantenphysik und Buddhismus gemeinsam? Und was haben Helgoland und Schrödingers Katze damit zu tun?\n\nCarlo Rovelli ist einer der weltweit führenden Quantenphysiker. Er befasst sich aber auch mit buddhistischen Philosophen wie Nagarjuna, über den Gert Scobel mit Rovelli spricht.\n\nWie seine berühmten Physik-Vorfahren Werner Heisenberg oder Max Planck schreibt Rovelli nicht nur über mathematisch sehr anspruchsvolle Gebiete der Physik wie beispielsweise der Schleifenquantengravitation. Er befasst sich auch mit Philosophie und Wissenschaftsgeschichte. Und so kommt er in seinem neuesten Buch auf die Verbindung von Philosophie und Quantenphysik.\n\nWie kann Philosophie der Wissenschaft dienen?\n\nWerner Heisenberg war 23, als er auf Helgoland die Quantenmechanik begründete. Er sah sich gezwungen eine Theorie zu entwickeln, die die Bewegungen der Elektronen in Atomen erklären würde, für die es zu dem Zeitpunkt noch keine schlüssige Antwort gab. Um der Lösung näher zu kommen, hinterfragte Heisenberg das Denken selbst.\n\nDie Philosophie entwickelte Begriffssysteme, die von Physikern wie Heisenberg verwendet wurden, um die Quantentheorie zu entwickeln.\n\nWie spielt der Beobachtende in die Beobachtung rein? Wer beobachtet ist immer Teil der Natur. Wenn alles miteinander interagiert, ist auch der Beobachtende Teil des Ganzen – Teil des Beobachtungsraums. Und darf somit sich selbst und seine Annahmen nicht außen vorlassen.\n\n\n\n\nLinks und Quellen:\n\nCarlo Rovelli: Helgoland.

  {"id":"supranAssessingExxonMobilGlobal2023","abstract":"Climate projections by the fossil fuel industry have never been assessed. On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the “carbon budget” for holding warming below 2°C. On each of these points, however, the company’s public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data.\n          , \n            Insider knowledge\n            \n              For decades, some members of the fossil fuel industry tried to convince the public that a causative link between fossil fuel use and climate warming could not be made because the models used to project warming were too uncertain. Supran\n              et al\n              . show that one of those fossil fuel companies, ExxonMobil, had their own internal models that projected warming trajectories consistent with those forecast by the independent academic and government models. What they understood about climate models thus contradicted what they led the public to believe. —HJS\n            \n          , \n            ExxonMobil’s own climate models showed that fossil fuel use would cause climate warming.\n          , \n            \n              BACKGROUND\n              In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with “dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.” Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry’s largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests’ knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp’s public communications promoted doubt on the matter.\n            \n            \n              ADVANCES\n              Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by—and in many cases modeled by—Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.\n              Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil’s average projected warming was 0.20° ± 0.04°C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average “skill score” and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil’s climate models (67 to 75% and ±21%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.\n              \n                Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a “carbon dioxide induced ‘super-interglacial’”; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 ± 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO\n                2\n                would lead to dangerous warming.\n              \n            \n            \n              OUTLOOK\n              Today, dozens of cities, counties, and states are suing oil and gas companies for their “longstanding internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and public deception campaigns.” The European Parliament and the US Congress have held hearings, US President Joe Biden has committed to holding fossil fuel companies accountable, and a grassroots social movement has arisen under the moniker #ExxonKnew. Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn’t just know “something” about global warming decades ago—they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it—including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.\n              \n                \n                  Historically observed temperature change (red) and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (blue) over time, compared against global warming projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists.\n                  \n                    (\n                    A\n                    ) “Proprietary” 1982 Exxon-modeled projections.

Full of alarming ideas (ghost waves, distant objects that seem to be magically connected, cats that appear both dead and alive), quantum physics has led to countless discoveries and technological advancements. Today our understanding of the world is based on this theory, yet it is still profoundly mysterious.\n\nAs scientists and philosophers continue to fiercely debate the meaning of the theory, Rovelli argues that its most unsettling contradictions can be explained by seeing the world as fundamentally made of relationships rather than substances. We and everything around us exist only in our interactions with one another. This bold idea suggests new directions for thinking about the structure of reality and even the nature of consciousness. Rovelli makes learning about quantum mechanics an almost psychedelic experience. Shifting our perspective once again, he takes us on a riveting journey through the universe so we can better comprehend our place in it.\n\nCarlo Rovelli is a theoretical physicist who has made significant contributions to the physics of space and time. He has worked in Italy and the United States, and is currently directing the Quantum Gravity research group of the Centre de Physique Théorique in Marseille, France. His books \"Seven Brief Lessons on Physics\", \"Reality Is Not What It Seems\", and \"The Order of Time\" are international bestsellers that have been translated into more than forty languages.\n\nGet the book here: https://goo.gle/2SMPoJR.\n\nModerated by Sanders Kleinfeld.\n\n#quantumtheory #quantumphysics #carlorovelli","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,30]]},"citation-key":"talksatgoogleCarloRovelliHelgoland2021","dimensions":"1:01:08","director":[{"literal":"Talks at Google"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,15]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"Carlo Rovelli | Helgoland: Making Sense of the Quantum Revolution | Talks at Google","title-short":"Carlo Rovelli | Helgoland","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWf2wyGQ0Q"},

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive, sectorally disaggregated, yet comparable projections for greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we project sectoral emissions until 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario for a global sample of countries and five main sectors, using a unified framework and Bayesian methods. We show that, without concerted policy efforts, global emissions increase strongly, and highlight a number of important differences across countries and sectors. Increases in emerging economies are driven by strong output and population growth, with emissions related to the energy sector accounting for most of the projected change. Advanced economies are expected to reduce emissions over the coming decades, although transport emissions often still show upward trends.

  {"id":"verniestExposureWetlandsImportant2024a","abstract":"Abstract\n            Sea‐level rise (SLR) is expected to cause major changes to coastal wetlands, which are among the world's most vulnerable ecosystems and are critical for nonbreeding waterbirds. Because strategies for adaptation to SLR, such as nature‐based solutions and designation of protected areas, can locally reduce the negative effects of coastal flooding under SLR on coastal wetlands, it is crucial to prioritize adaptation efforts, especially for wetlands of international importance for biodiversity. We assessed the exposure of coastal wetlands important for nonbreeding waterbirds to projected SLR along the Mediterranean coasts of 8 countries by modeling future coastal flooding under 7 scenarios of SLR by 2100 (from 44‐ to 161‐cm rise) with a static inundation approach. Exposure to coastal flooding under future SLR was assessed for 938 Mediterranean coastal sites (≤30 km from the coastline) where 145 species of nonbreeding birds were monitored as part of the International Waterbird Census and for which the monitoring area was delineated by a polygon (64.3% of the coastal sites monitored in the Mediterranean region). Thirty‐four percent of sites were threatened by future SLR, even under the most optimistic scenarios. Protected study sites and study sites of international importance for waterbirds were, respectively, 1.5 and 2 times more exposed to SLR than the other sites under the most optimistic scenario. Accordingly, we advocate for the development of a prioritization scheme to be applied to these wetlands for the implementation of strategies for adaptation to SLR to anticipate the effects of coastal flooding. Our study provides major guidance for conservation planning under global change in several countries of the Mediterranean region.\n          , \n            \n              \n              Exposición de los humedales de importancia para las aves acuáticas no reproductoras al incremento del nivel del mar en el Mediterráneo\n              \n                Resumen\n                Se espera que el incremento en el nivel del mar (INM) cause cambios importantes en los humedales costeros, los cuales se encuentran entre los ecosistemas más vulnerables y son críticos para las aves acuáticas no reproductoras. Es crucial la priorización de los esfuerzos de adaptación, especialmente en los humedales con importancia internacional para la biodiversidad, ya que las estrategias de adaptación ante el INM, como las soluciones basadas en la naturaleza y la designación de áreas protegidas, pueden reducir localmente los efectos negativos de las inundaciones costeras por INM en los humedales costeros. Evaluamos la exposición de los humedales costeros con importancia para las aves acuáticas no reproductoras ante el INM proyectado en las costas del Mediterráneo en ocho países con un modelo de inundaciones costeras en el futuro bajo siete escenarios de INM para el año 2100 (de 44 a 161 cm) con un enfoque de inundación estática. Evaluamos la exposición a las inundaciones costeras bajo el INM futuro en 938 sitios costeros del Mediterráneo (≤ 30 km a partir de la costa), en donde monitoreamos a 145 especies de aves no reproductoras como parte del Censo Internacional de Aves Acuáticas y para los cuales el área de monitoreo estuvo delineada con un polígono (64.3% de los sitios costeros monitoreados en la región Mediterránea). El 34% de los sitios se vio amenazado por el INM en el futuro, incluso con los escenarios más optimistas. Los sitios de estudio protegidos y los sitios de estudio de importancia internacional para las aves acuáticas estuvieron expuestos 1.5 y 2 veces más al INM que otros sitios con el escenario más optimista. De acuerdo con esto, abogamos por el desarrollo de un esquema de priorización para aplicarse en estos humedales para la implementación de estrategias de adaptación al INM para anticipar los efectos de las inundaciones costeras.

  {"id":"weberAreClimateActivists2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            The parties to the Aarhus Convention recently established a new Rapid Response Mechanism for environmental defenders. This article analyses this mechanism and its guarantees for environmental defenders, with a specific focus on the protection of diverse forms of climate activism. The Convention's Compliance Committee has taken a broad approach towards the definition of ‘environmental defenders’ protected by Article 3(8) of the Convention. This definition includes persons who engage in demonstrations or rallies connected to environmental issues, even if there is no immediate link to the rights provided by the Aarhus Convention. In some cases, direct actions and acts of civil disobedience may fall under Article 3(8) of the Convention. Where environmental defenders suffer harmful acts such as penalization, harassment or persecution either by State authorities or private parties, the State concerned must produce evidence to show that these harmful acts were not a response to the civic engagement of the environmental defenders concerned. If environmental defenders are victims of harmful acts in the sense of Article 3(8) of the Aarhus Convention, they may address the Special Rapporteur who can swiftly issue protection measures. This could be especially relevant for detained persons, persons under police supervision or activists who undergo systematic harassment by the police or private security forces. In these cases, the Special Rapporteur may intervene and use their unique position on the international plane to ensure that environmental defenders do not suffer due to their engagement for the environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Teresa"}],"citation-key":"weberAreClimateActivists2023","container-title":"Review of European, Comparative & International Environmental Law","container-title-short":"Rev Euro Comp Intl Enviro","DOI":"10.1111/reel.12465","ISSN":"2050-0386, 2050-0394","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"67-76","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Are climate activists protected by the Aarhus Convention?

  {"id":"wendtSouthernOceanDrives2024a","abstract":"The last glacial period was punctuated by cold intervals in the North Atlantic region that culminated in extensive iceberg discharge events. These cold intervals, known as Heinrich Stadials, are associated with abrupt climate shifts worldwide. Here, we present CO\n              2\n              measurements from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core across Heinrich Stadials 2 to 5 at decadal-scale resolution. Our results reveal multi-decadal-scale jumps in atmospheric CO\n              2\n              concentrations within each Heinrich Stadial. The largest magnitude of change (14.0 ± 0.8 ppm within 55 ± 10 y) occurred during Heinrich Stadial 4. Abrupt rises in atmospheric CO\n              2\n              are concurrent with jumps in atmospheric CH\n              4\n              and abrupt changes in the water isotopologs in multiple Antarctic ice cores, the latter of which suggest rapid warming of both Antarctica and Southern Ocean vapor source regions. The synchroneity of these rapid shifts points to wind-driven upwelling of relatively warm, carbon-rich waters in the Southern Ocean, likely linked to a poleward intensification of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. Using an isotope-enabled atmospheric circulation model, we show that observed changes in Antarctic water isotopologs can be explained by abrupt and widespread Southern Ocean warming. Our work presents evidence for a multi-decadal- to century-scale response of the Southern Ocean to changes in atmospheric circulation, demonstrating the potential for dynamic changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry and circulation on human timescales. Furthermore, it suggests that anthropogenic CO\n              2\n              uptake in the Southern Ocean may weaken with poleward strengthening westerlies today and into the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Wendt","given":"Kathleen A."},{"family":"Nehrbass-Ahles","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Niezgoda","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Noone","given":"David"},{"family":"Kalk","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Menviel","given":"Laurie"},{"family":"Gottschalk","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Rae","given":"James W.
